research phase therapeutic priority sequence steps cancer drug development the initial step (basic research) involves identification pro-mitotic “driver” protein implicated tumor growth next (translational) step involves isolation lead compound synthetic drug capable inhibiting functional activity driver protein – usually enzyme receptor final steps involve clinical trials assessing not only drug’s safety dosimetry (phase 1) tumorilytic efficacy (phase 2) but durability otherwise tumor-inhibiting efficacy hence any survival gain compared standard treatments (phase 3) unfortunately dynamic reductions durability drug control – distinct de novo resistance – often arise secondary selection repair defects (accelerating tumor progression) and/or apoptotic defects (reducing tumor response)
