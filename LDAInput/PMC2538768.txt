epidermal growth factor receptor mutations detected metastatic tumours three (12%) patients ( table 2 )

13) exon 21 could not detected patients' primary tumour samples
we confirmed non-classical mutations detected our series not single nucleotide polymorphisms mutation analysis matched normal tissue blood (data not shown)
consequently egfr gene status could classified as: (i) egfr wild type both primary tumour metastasis ( n =18 patients 72%) (ii) egfr mutations detected only primary tumour ( n =4 patients 16%) metastases ( n =2 patients 8%) both ( n =1 patient 4%)
therefore egfr mutation status showed discordance 28% (7 25 patients) (mcnemar test p =0.688) between primary tumour corresponding metastasis ( table 3 )

there no correlation between expression egfr py1173-egfr

several studies shown activating egfr mutations exons 18 19 21 been associated 75?95% objective response rate egfr tkis whereas k-ras mutations associated lack sensitivity agents ( pao et al 2005 sharma et al 2007 )
epidermal growth factor receptor gene amplification protein expression been considered predictors clinical benefit gefitinib ( hirsch et al 2006 )
however clinical studies significant percentage patients presented clinical benefit when treated tkis irrespective expression mutational status egfr ( sharma et al 2007 )
most studies egfr expression mutations determined primary tumour observed clinical benefit patients wild-type egfr absence response tkis patients egfr mutations could due discordance egfr mutation status expression between primary tumour corresponding metastasis
study demonstrated existence significant discordance egfr k-ras mutations occurring primary tumours their corresponding metastases patients nsclc
discordance egfr mutation status 28% k-ras 24%
similarly two other studies paired nsclc tumours showed discordance 32 27% regarding egfr gene copy number ( italiano et al 2006 bozzetti et al 2008 ) whereas another study including six nsclc patients asian ethnicity reported 100% concordance regard egfr mutation status ( matsumoto et al 2006 )
discrepancy could related different sites metastatic tumours analysed study (five different distant metastases) whereas matsumoto's et al study only tumour samples brain metastases included
diverse sites metastases nsclc probably represent different clonal outgrowths
alternatively we cannot exclude different ethnicity patients and/or different types egfr mutations could reason discrepancy ( tsao et al 2006 pallis et al 2007 )
study including only caucasian patients three classical activating (del19 e746v) four non-classical mutations (t847a l692p-v717a l692p g857e) detected whereas matsumoto's et al study only classical activating del19 l858r mutations reported
concerning non-classical mutations unlikely represent pcr artifacts l692f t847i g857e egfr mutations been previously reported ( fujimoto et al 2005 tsao et al 2005 hsieh et al 2006 )
furthermore expression phosphorylated egfr (py1173-egfr-positive) tumour cells metastatic lesions carrying t847a l692p-v717a mutations strongly suggests former might activating egfr mutation
time elapsed between diagnoses primary tumour corresponding metastasis patients (nos
13 12) carrying abovementioned mutations 74.5 10 months respectively
therefore acquisition new mutations may developed during evolution metastatic process
administration tkis could additional explanation observed discordance egfr mutations
three out 25 patients received gefitinib before development metachronous metastasis whereas none patients reported matsumoto's et al study exposed tkis
known nsclc patients egfr-dependent primary tumours when treated tkis develop metastases either egfr signalling negated resistance acquired due secondary egfr mutations like t790m met amplification ( daneshmand et al 2003 gazdar minna 2005 engelman et al 2007 lutterbach et al 2007 )
interesting note patients who not been exposed tkis before biopsy metastatic lesions 18% (4 out 22 patients) discordance observed between primary tumours related metastases
however final explanation observed discordance cannot excluded concerns low-frequency intratumoral heterogeneity occurrence egfr mutations ( sakurada et al 2008 )
our findings concerning k-ras mutation status agreement previous study demonstrating k-ras mutational status primary tumour does not always predict status bone metastasis nsclc ( badalian et al 2007 )
similar phenomenon reported patients colorectal cancer ( tortola et al 2001 )
although k-ras mutations seem associated early development nsclc cannot excluded k-ras mutations lost later during tumour progression ( burmer loeb 1989 li et al 1994 )
may part explain discordance k-ras mutation status between primary tumours metachronous metastases
another possibility observed discordance egfr k-ras mutation status could related administered chemotherapy
however shown table 1 among 10 patients who not received any treatment before mutation analysis metastatic lesions 5 developed metastases different mutation status corresponding primary tumours
thus although tumour clone selection through various treatments could explanation different molecular pattern primary tumour metastatic site our findings suggest metastasis genotype could different corresponding primary tumour irrespectively administered chemotherapy
previous studies shown egfr k-ras mutations mutually exclusive suggesting presence different pathways lung carcinogenesis
however previously reported our data show k-ras mutation may coexist egfr mutation ( fujimoto et al 2005 han et al 2006 )
among five patients egfr mutations primary tumours one patient concomitantly k-ras mutation (g12c deletion exon 19)
metachronous metastasis only k-ras mutation retained
patient received gefitinib after biopsy metastatic lesion stable disease lasting 3.5 months
limited duration response compatible knowledge presence k-ras mutations associated resistance tkis
study expression py1173-egfr different between primary tumours corresponding metastases eight (50%) patients whereas egfr expression discordant two (10%) patients
apparent lack correlation between egfr p-egfr expression been previously reported could due different scoring systems different sensitivities antibodies used evaluate egfr p-egfr expressions ( han et al 2005 )
well known overexpression egfr associated tyr phosphorylation receptor proteins mutations kinase domain may cause constitutive phosphorylation egfr ( chen et al 2006 )
however biochemical studies shown variable phosphorylation rates associated different tyrosine phosphorylation sites receptor g719s mutant receptor less egf-induced phosphorylation y845 y992 y1068 y1173 did wild-type egfr whereas l858r mutant receptor preferentially phosphorylated y1068 but not y1173 ( sordella et al 2004 chen et al 2006 liu et al 2007 )
clinical investigations suggested correlation between high egfr gene copy number egfr mutations ( cappuzzo et al 2005 takano et al 2005 )
our study failed demonstrate such correlation probably due limited number cases analysed
evaluable paired tissue specimens fluorescence situ hybridisation analysis available eight patients
among them two (nos 13 19) patients presented different egfr mutation status primary tumours corresponding metastases however two patients harbour non-classical egfr mutations (t847a g857e) did not show different egfr amplification patterns between paired samples
basis findings present time we consider only genetic differences unequivocally distinguish egfr-dependent tumours likely sensitive tkis tumours could resistant agents ( papadopoulos et al 2006 )
conclusion our findings indicate substantial discordance egfr k-ras mutations between primary tumours corresponding metastases nsclc underline need consider genotype both primary metastatic tumours selecting patients who will respond therapy tkis.
