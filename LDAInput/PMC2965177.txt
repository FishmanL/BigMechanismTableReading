ras association domain family 1 (rassf1) gene ras effector encoding two major mrna forms rassf1a rassf1c derived alternative promoter selection alternative mrna splicing
rassf1a tumor suppressor gene
however very little known about function rassf1c both normal transformed cells
gene silencing over-expression techniques used modulate rassf1c expression human breast cancer cells
affymetrix-microarray analysis performed using t47d cells over-expressing rassf1c identify rassf1c target genes
rt-pcr western blot techniques used validate target gene expression
cell invasion apoptosis assays performed
article we report effects altering rassf1c expression human breast cancer cells
we found silencing rassf1c mrna breast cancer cell lines (mda-mb231 t47d) caused small but significant decrease cell proliferation
conversely inducible over-expression rassf1c breast cancer cells (mda-mb231 t47d) resulted small increase cell proliferation
we report identification novel rassf1c target genes
rassf1c down-regulates several pro-apoptotic tumor suppressor genes up-regulates several growth promoting genes breast cancer cells
we further show down-regulation caspase 3 via overexpression rassf1c reduces breast cancer cells' sensitivity apoptosis inducing agent etoposide
furthermore we found rassf1c over-expression enhances t47d cell invasion/migration vitro 
together our findings suggest rassf1c unlike rassf1a not tumor suppressor but instead may play role stimulating metastasis survival breast cancer cells
ras association domain family 1 (rassf1) proteins postulated function ras effectors affect cell growth
rassf1 gene resides chromosome 3p21.3 region often undergoes homozygous heterozygous deletions hypermethylation-induced suppression many human cancers [ 1 2 ]
rassf1 gene encodes multiple isoforms derived alternative promoter selection alternative mrna splicing [ 1 2 ] two major isoforms called rassf1a rassf1c
rassfia protein (340 amino acids) contains amino-terminal diacyl glycerol binding domain (c1 domain) ataxia telangiectasia mutated (atm) phosphorylation site carboxy-terminal putative ras association (ra) domain
rassfic protein (270 amino acids) contains atm phosphorylation site ra domain but not c1 domain [ 1 2 ]
rassf1a tumor suppressor gene epigenetically inactivated cytidine methylation many human solid tumors
been reported 80 100% lung cancer cell lines tumors [ 1 - 4 ] 49 62% breast cancers [ 3 5 ] 67 70% nasopharyngeal cancers [ 6 ] 90% hepatocellular carcinomas [ 7 ] 91% renal cell carcinomas [ 8 ] 70% prostate cancers [ 9 10 ] rassf1a gene but not rassf1c gene inactivated
addition rassf1a over-expression reduces colony formation suppresses anchorage independent growth inhibits tumor growth nude mice inhibits cell growth inducing g1-s phase cell cycle arrest blocking cyclin d accumulation [ 2 8 11 12 ]
studies rassf1a knockout mice showed rassf1a -/- rassf1a+/- mice exhibit enhanced tumor multiplicity tumor size compared wild type animals upon exposure chemical carcinogens benzo(a) pyrene urethane [ 13 ]
rassf1c isoform differs rassf1a isoform having distinct n-terminus lacking diacyl glycerol binding domain
unlike rassf1a rassf1c not been extensively studied very little known about its role cell growth survival metastasis
contrast rassf1a rassf1c expressed almost all human solid tumors
majority published literature indicates rassf1c no tumor-suppressor activity [ 2 9 11 12 14 ]
however some reports suggest rassf1c may function tumor suppressor ovarian prostate renal cancer cells [ 15 - 17 ]
we recently identified rassf1c insulin-like growth factor binding protein-5 (igfbp-5) interacting protein shown silencing rassf1c expression resulted significant decrease osteosarcoma lung cancer cell proliferation [ 18 19 ]
we shown over-expression rassf1c increased cell proliferation lung cancer cell line nci h1299 suggesting growth promoting role rassf1c lung cancer cells [ 19 ]

data suggests potential role rassf1c cancer cell metastasis perhaps through up-regulation cxcr gene expression
addition t47d cells we show mda-mb231 cells over-expressing rassf1c more invasive control cells (figure 4c )
all together our novel findings suggest rassf1c may promote breast cancer cell invasion/migration perhaps part through up-regulation expression cxcr4 gene
etoposide chemotherapy agent known induce apoptosis through activation caspase 3
since over-expression rassf1c down-regulates caspase 3 expression we hypothesized over-expression rassf1c would reduce amount active caspase 3 induced etoposide
we tested hypothesis measuring amount caspase 3 produced response etoposide t47d breast cancer cells either over-express normally express rassf1c
rassf1c over-expressing cells (t47d-1c) exhibit reduced caspase 3 activity compared cells do not over-express rassf1c (t47d-bb) when treated etoposide (figure 5 )
further show prolonged over-expression rassf1c does not promote apoptosis breast cancer cells dna fragmentation analysis carried out using genomic dna isolated breast cancer cells treated 1 ?g/ml doxycycline 14 days
over-expression rassf1c did not induce dna fragmentation breast cancer cells (figure 6 )
findings further support our hypothesis rassf1c plays role promoting breast cancer cell growth may allow cancer cells evade killing chemotherapy agents
caspase 3 activity measured t47d cells stably transduced mlv-ha-rassf1c (t47d-rassf1c) 
t47d cells treated doxycycline (d) and/or 45 um/ml etoposide (e) 48 hr
cells subsequently assayed caspase 3 activity
rassf1c over-expression down regulates expression caspase 3 hence less caspase 3 activity observed t47d-1c cells treated both d e compared cells treated e alone (p < 0.01)
data normalized t47d cells treated vehicle assay carried least three independent times n = 4
t47d mda-mb231 hs578t cells stably transduced empty mlv-backbone (t47d- mda- hs578t-bb) mlv-ha-rassf1c (t47d- mda- hs578t-1c) vectors treated 1 ?g/ml doxycycline 14 days 
genomic dna isolated dna fragmentation analysis using apoptotic dna ladder (adl) kit
clear dna fragmentation did not occur all three cell lines tested suggesting rassf1c over-expression does not induce apoptosis
function rassf1c not been extensively studied rassf1a
initial reports literature suggested rassf1c might function tumor suppressor ovarian prostate renal cancer cells [ 15 - 17 ]
recently rassf1c been shown interact daxx protein involved apoptosis transcriptional repression
been suggested rassf1c may contribute activation stress-activated protein-kinase/c-jun n-terminal kinase [ 17 ]
contrast we recently demonstrated rassf1c promotes lung cancer cell proliferation [ 19 ]
we previously showed rassf1c plays role promoting osteoblast cell proliferation through interaction insulin like growth factor binding protein (igfbp)-5 [ 18 ]
consistent our hypothesis another group recently shown rassf1c interacts ?trcp (the receptor subunit scf?trcp ubiquitin ligase recruits signaling proteins cell cycle regulators proteosomal degradation) [ 41 ]
through mechanism rassf1c over-expression human lung cancer cell line a549 promotes accumulation ?-catenin oncogene key player wnt signaling pathway leading increased transcriptional activation cell proliferation [ 41 ]
study we demonstrated reduction rassf1c mrna breast cancer cells correlated small but statistically significant decrease cell proliferation compared control cells express rassf1c
reduction rassf1c did not affect cell viability judged trypan blue staining (data not shown)
overall our results consistent those we obtained osteosarcoma (te85 mg63 u2) lung cancer (nci h1299) cells [ 18 19 ]
studies osteosarcoma cells effects silencing rassf1c cells express both rassf1a rassf1c (te85) very similar those observed cells express only rassf1c (mg63 u2) clearly indicating rassf1a does not modulate effect rassf1c cell proliferation survival [ 18 ]
based observations we think unlike rassf1a rassf1c not tumor suppressor least breast bone lung
instead may function growth-stimulating factor
further determine effect(s) rassf1c breast cancer cell proliferation we used tetracycline-regulated mlv-based vector stably over-express rassf1c mda-mb231 t47d
tetracycline-regulated over-expression rassf1c did not inhibit cell proliferation
fact over-expression rassf1c caused reproducible statistically significant increase cell proliferation further suggesting rassf1c not growth suppressor gene
support we found expression rassf1c elevated breast cancer cell lines compared primary mammary epithelial cells consistent our hypothesis rassf1c may act potential growth survival factor breast cancer
mentioned above recent study suggested regulated over-expression rassf1c may inhibit growth prostate cancer (lncap) renal cell carcinoma (krc/y) cells [ 15 ]
however we now shown rassf1c over-expression does not inhibit cell growth but rather significantly increases proliferation osteosarcoma [ 18 ] lung cancer [ 19 ] breast cancer (this study) cells
different findings related stimulatory function rassf1c human osteosarcoma breast cancer lung cancer cells [ 18 19 21 41 ] inhibitory function rassf1c prostate kidney ovarian cancer cells [ 15 - 17 ] may due tissue-specific actions rassf1c
well known some proteins such igfbp-5 fhit (fragile histidine triad) exert opposite effects different tissues [ 42 43 ]
our silencing over-expression studies rassf1c underscores potential growth promoting function least breast lung osteosarcoma cell lines
begin address effect rassf1c cellular growth we carried out microarray study identify novel rassf1c target genes
we found rassf1c over-expression interestingly modulated expression number genes involved cancer development cell growth/proliferation cell cycle cell death apoptosis
we validated expression several rassf1c target genes qrt-pcr validated expression caspase 3 cxcr4 ghr tgm2 western blot analysis
we found cancer cells over-expressing rassf1c exhibited increased phosphorylation erk1/2 compared control cells (but no increase total erk1/2 levels) suggesting rassf1c may exert its activities part through activation erk1/2 pathway
we show breast cancer cells over-expressing rassf1c showed enhanced invasion/migration while cells knockdown rassf1c expression reduced invasion/migration compared control cells
addition we found rassf1c over-expressing cells exhibited reduced caspase 3 activity compared control cells when treated etoposide
we found over-expressing rassf1c 14 days did not induce apoptosis judged lack dna fragmentation hs578t mda-mb231 t47d cells further suggesting rassf1c does not promote apoptosis
taken together findings consistent our hypothesis rassf1c may potentially function metastasis promoting apoptosis attenuating protein breast cancer cells perhaps through modulation cxcr4 caspase 3 gene expression respectively
our findings together others' building case rassf1c rassf1a opposing antagonistic functions least breast lung bone cancer cells
instance been reported rassf1a inhibits lung cancer cell migration promotes cell adhesion [ 44 ]
rassf1a been shown activate pro-apoptotic bax1 gene [ 45 ] consistent its tumor suppressing activities
study we shown rassf1c promotes cell migration down-regulates pro-apoptotic genes such bax caspase 3 srpx
rassf1c over-expression up-regulates expression inhibitor differentiation (id2) been shown down-regulated rassf1a nasopharyngeal carcinoma [ 46 ]
rassf1c down-regulates tgm2 gene expression up-regulated rassf1a non-small cell lung cancer cell line a549 [ 47 ]
lastly our rassf1c studies breast cancer lung cancer osteosarcoma cells well other reports literature [ 41 ] suggest rassf1c functions opposing manner rassf1a
all studies rassf1c appears stimulate cell growth while rassf1a well established suppress it
thus fine balance rassf1a rassf1c isoform expression may critical determining neoplastic potential cell
mentioned above microarray analyses mrna cells subjected forced expression rassf1c stimulates expression silencing rassf1c reduces expression genes associated cell growth proliferation
data provide significant information propose testable models explain how rassf1c exerts growth promoting activities breast cancer
example up-regulation cxcr4 rassf1c interesting discovery suggesting hypothesis rassf1c may play role promoting breast cancer metastasis mentioned above
recent studies shown cxcr4 expression increased early transition normal transformed breast epithelium [ 48 ]
cxcr4 signaling receptor interacts cognate ligand (sdf-1 known cxcl12) expressed higher levels tissues attract breast cancer cells support metastasis (e.g bone liver lung)
cxcr4 interaction sdf-1 activates pi3k erk1/2 pathways promotes cancer cell proliferation metastasis [ 48 49 ]
light findings we proposing testable model rassf1c action (see figure 7 ) based hypothesis rassf1c increases expression cxcr4 pre-malignant/malignant breast epithelial cells thus supporting successful seeding metastases sites express high levels sdf-1
we plan test model others delineate molecular mechanism/pathway(s) through rassf1c exerts its growth promoting effects breast cancer cells using both vitro vivo approaches
hypothetical model proposed explain rassf1c action breast cancer cells: we hypothesize rassf1c activates ras-raf-erk1/2 pathway leading up-regulation cxcr4 
breast cancer cells expressing high number cxcr4 receptor attracted migrate secondary tissue sites where cognate ligand (cxcl12) expressed higher levels (e.g bone liver lung)
conclusion together our previous work rassf1c osteosarcoma lung cancer cells our present findings breast cancer cells provide further evidence rassf1c not tumor suppressor instead may promote metastasis survival cancer cells
our studies further suggest rassf1c may accomplish up-regulation specific growth promoting genes down-regulation specific pro-apoptotic genes
