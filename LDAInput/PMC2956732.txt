rassf2 methylated 88% thyroid cancer cell lines 63% primary thyroid carcinomas
rassf2 methylation significantly increased primary thyroid carcinoma compared normal thyroid goiter follicular adenoma (0% 17% 0% respectively p < 0.05)
patients older 60 years significantly hypermethylated rassf2 their primary thyroid tumors compared those younger 40 years (90% vs

results suggest rassf2 encodes novel epigenetically inactivated candidate tumor suppressor gene thyroid carcinogenesis
approximately 10% whole population develop clinically significant thyroid nodule during their lifetime [ 1 ]
nearly 80% all thyroid malignancies arise follicular epithelial cells thyrocytes
there three main histological types epithelial thyroid cancer: papillary thyroid carcinoma (ptc) follicular thyroid carcinoma (ftc) undifferentiated (or anaplastic) thyroid carcinoma (utc)
contrast medullary thyroid carcinoma (mtc) develop parafollicular c cells
c cells produce calcitonin hormone regulating calcium metabolism [ 2 ]
development progression thyroid tumors consequence complex epigenetic genetic changes
our previous work we identified novel ras effector located tumor suppressor gene locus 3p21.3 [ 3 ]
gene termed ras association domain family 1a ( rassf1a ) epigenetically inactivated human cancers inhibits growth tumors vivo [ 4 5 ]

rassf1a first member ras association domain family (rassf)
family consists six classical rassfs (rassf1 rassf6) n-terminal rassfs (rassf7 rassf10) n-terminal ras association (ra) domain [ 13 - 17 ]
classical rassfs encode c-terminal ra sarah domain [ 13 16 ]
several genes (e.g
rassf1a rassf2 rassf5 [nore1] rassf6 ) encode tumor suppressors involved cell cycle regulation microtubule stability apoptosis [ 13 16 18 - 20 ]

here we report rassf2 frequently hypermethylated thyroid tumors suppresses growth thyroid cancer
our study we aimed reveal role classical rassf members harbor c-terminal ra domain sarah domain their effectors mst1 mst2 ww45 thyroid carcinogenesis
since rassf1a function silencing already studied detail we focused our work rassf2 rassf3 rassf4 rassf5a rassf5c rassf6 all encode c-terminal sarah domain [ 7 10 13 ]
first we analyzed promoter methylation genes thyroid cancer cell lines (fig

statistical analysis revealed significant increase rassf2 methylation frequency thyroid cancer compared normal thyroid controls follicular adenomas goiters (p < 0.001 p = 0.001 p = 0.015 fisher's exact test respectively)
furthermore we examined methylation frequency rassf2 different types thyroid carcinoma (tab

medullary thyroid carcinoma showed lowest frequency (0/3 = 0%) comparison ptc (6/11 = 54%) ftc (8/10 = 80%) utc (5/6 = 83%)
methylation rassf2 significantly higher thyroid tumors obtained older patients (90% >60 year) compared those younger patients (38% <40 years p = 0.043) patients 41 59 years (58%)
other correlations histopathological parameters not revealed
we analyzed rassf5a methylation primary thyroid cancers other thyroid tissues (fig

deletion sarah domain did not alter localization fluorescent rassf2 rassf3 rassf6
however rassf1a rassf4 appear localize nucleus cytoplasm
interesting note utilized rassf5a isoform (variant 4) contains partially truncated sarah domain
sarah domain protein-protein interaction domain found all classical rassfs their proapoptotic effector mst1 mst2 adapter protein ww45
therefore we analyzed interaction proteins yeast two hybrid pull down assays (table 2 fig

samples separated 10% page gel blotted
precipitated co-precipitated proteins determined anti-flag-antibodies
sizes protein marker (m) indicated
interaction rassf2 kinases mst1 mst2 indicate rassf2 involved proapoptotic rassf-pathway
therefore we analyzed rassf2-induced growth suppression apoptosis thyroid cancer cell lines (fig

thyroid cancer cell line 1736 transfected construct expressing rassf2 under control cmv promoter empty vector (fig

after selection 4 weeks 65% decrease colony formation cancer cells transfected rassf2 (mean = 4.6) compared cells transfected empty vector (mean = 13.6 p = 0.019 one-way anova test) observed (fig

additionally we analyzed rassf2 induced apoptosis 1736 ftc133 cells (fig

transfection fluorescent rassf2 caused significantly increased apoptosis indicated nuclei condensation/fragmentation compared fluorescent vector 1736 ftc133 (p < 0.001 p = 0.07 respectively)
apoptotic cells exemplarily verified tunel assay (fig

our yeast two hybrid assay confirmed bindings additionally binding rassf1a rassf2 observed
however interactions not observed pulldown (tab

general only strong yeast two hybrid interactions could confirmed pulldowns
since yeast two hybrid assays prone false positive results we rather agree pull down interactions
rassf2 binds both proapoptotic kinases mst1 mst2 yeast two hybrid assays confirmed rassf2 mst1 pulldown
been suggested binding classical rassfs mst1 mst2 ww45 other conducted their sarah domains [ 21 ]
deletion sarah domain rassf2 abolished binding mst1 mst2 [ 36 37 ]
interesting note all rassfs ww45 bind mst1 however only certain rassfs (e.g
rassf1a rassf5c) bind other pulldowns
result suggests sarah domains show different binding properties
rassf2 exhibits several tumor suppressor properties like inhibition cell growth induction apoptosis [ 20 27 ]
here we show rassf2 acts novel tumor suppressor thyroid carcinogenesis
been shown rassf2 binds regulates proapoptotic kinases mst1 mst2 [ 36 37 ]
rassf2 engages jnk pathway induces apoptosis mst1-independent manner [ 37 ]
other findings suggest mst2 rassf2 form complex rassf2 maintained phosphorylated state mst2 protects mst2 degradation turnover [ 36 ]
however exact phosphorylation site rassf2 mst2 not revealed
additionally we found rassf5a frequently hypermethylated thyroid tissues however methylation not tumor specific since observed controls
epigenetic silencing rassf5 thyroid cancer been analyzed previously but not tumor specific [ 11 12 ]
interestingly rassf5a rassf2 methylation reduced mtc compared other cancers
been reported rassf5a expression suppressed ftc carrying pax8-ppar? fusions [ 11 ]
methylation other investigated cpg island promoters ras effectors ( rassf3 rassf4 mst1 mst2 ww45 ) uncommon
summary we report frequent tumor-specific hypermethylation rassf2 thyroid cancer
