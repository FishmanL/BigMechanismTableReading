we previously described k-ras mutations codons 12 13 61 series 106 unselected colorectal tumours ( smith et al 2002 )
our k-ras mutation analysis performed direct sequencing k-ras exon 1 (codons 12 13) exon 2 (codon 61) would therefore detected any additional mutations exons
codon 12 mutations detected 23 tumours (21.7%) codon 13 mutations 6 tumours (5.7%) whereas no codon 61 mutations detected
mutations codon 19 (g57t leu19phe) b-raf (v600e) found single tumours ( table 2 )
identify additional k-ras mutations establish relative frequencies individual k-ras mutations human colorectal tumours we used wave analysis followed direct sequencing screen same tumour series mutations k-ras exon 3 exon 4b most common exon 4 splice variant
four additional sequence changes identified ? c change (lys asn substitution) codon 117 g change (ala thr substitution) codon 146 g change (arg gln substitution) codon 164 ?silent' c t nucleotide substitution did not alter aspartic acid residue codon 173 ( table 2 )
together k-ras mutations b-raf v600e mutation increase overall ras pathway mutation frequency 27.4 37.8%
predicted localisation mutation functional domains k-ras protein illustrated figure 2 
determine whether our reported sequence changes represented tumour-specific mutations single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) genomic dna blood tumour tissue compared
sequence changes codons 19 117 146 164 only detected tumour dna whereas codon 173 sequence change detected both blood tumour dna therefore represented snp ( table 2 )
determine frequencies codon 117 146 164 k-ras mutations codon 173 snp pcr?rflp assays designed permit rapid screening blood tumour dna ( appendix )
like codon 19 mutation codon 117 codon 164 mutations found single tumours whereas codon 146 mutation found 7 out 106 (6.5%) tumours

compare transformation potential k-ras mutants therefore nih3t3 cells transiently transfected plasmids expressing wt k-ras k-ras mutations g12v g12d g13d q61h l19f k117n a146t r164q
equivalence plasmid loading assessed spectrophotometrically western blotting k-ras (data not shown)

no foci observed untransfected cells cells transfected wt k-ras whereas abundant foci seen hotspot k-ras mutation ( figure 3a )
codon 12 mutations slightly greater transforming potential codon 13 mutations consistently greater transforming potential codon 61 q61h mutation ( figure 3c )
after transfection additional k-ras mutations significant focus formation observed codon 117 146 mutations ( figure 3b )
contrast codon 164 mutation phenotypically equivalent wt k-ras no evidence foci formation codon 19 mutation generated low but consistent numbers isolated foci ( figure 3c )
assess k-ras mutations active gtp-bound conformation raf-1 binding assay carried out described materials methods
raf-1 selectively binds gtp-bound ras (rather inactive gdp-bound form) following immunoprecipitation visualised western blotting
figure 4 illustrates results our analysis where consistent our focus formation experiments k-ras g12v l19f k117n a146t mutations clearly active gtp-bound conformation
contrast r164q mutation like wt k-ras not gtp-bound
further compare contrast phenotypes associated k-ras mutants transcription-profiling experiments carried out described materials methods
hierarchical clustering analysis revealed presence two major gene clusters ?cluster 1' containing g12v g12c g12d mutants ?cluster 2' containing g13d a146t k117n r164q l19f ( figure 5 )
interesting note codon 12 mutants most similar wt k-ras whereas k117n a146t mutants clustered activating codon 13 codon 61 hotspot mutants
l19f r164q mutants formed subcluster within cluster 2 suggesting consistent our foci formation data mutants phenotypically distinct g13d a146t k117n mutants
presence l19f cluster 2 consistent our ras gtpase assay data whereas contrast our experimental data r164q predicted ?wt' ras phenotype
presence r164q cluster 2 rather cluster 1 wt k-ras therefore initially surprising but suggests r164q mutation ?activating' phenotype albeit attenuated relative other mutations studied
further investigate phenotypes associated k-ras mutants expression diverse selection genes associated variety cellular processes including signal transduction cytoskeleton remodelling cell adhesion compared
although further analysis complex dataset including composite analysis biological pathways processes ongoing will discussed more detail future manuscript representative examples genes showing differential expression following introduction k-ras mutant summarised table 3

investigate whether altered k-ras activity could additionally result gene amplification k-ras gene copy number assay designed carried out described materials methods k-ras copy number compared normal tumour tissues
total 2 96 tumour pairs analysed (2.1%) showed tumour-specific copy number increases ( figure 6 ) one (study code 1264 wt k-ras ) 4 tumour copies k-ras other (study code 1233 wt k-ras ) 27 copies k-ras gene

recent clinical data shown compelling association between k-ras b-raf mutation status response egfr blockade cetuximab panitumumab treatment metastatic colorectal tumours ( benvenuti et al 2007 khambata-ford et al 2007 freeman et al 2008 karapetis et al 2008 ramos et al 2008 )
k-ras mutations colorectal tumours been extensively documented where recent meta analysis more 3000 tumours estimates average k-ras mutation frequency 34.8% ( andreyev et al 2001 )
majority previous analyses however limited codons 12 13 whereas only minority studies additionally analysed codon 61
although additional k-ras mutations been reported outwith ?hotspot' codons our knowledge there been no systematic analysis k-ras mutation frequency human colorectal tumours
our use ?wave' denaturing hplc (dhplc) analysis ( kuklin et al 1997 ) allowed us carry out rapid systematic analysis entire k-ras coding sequence identify colorectal tumours sequence changes nature subsequently confirmed conventional dideoxy sequencing
our data clearly demonstrates k-ras mutations human colorectal tumours likely significantly underestimated only hotspot codons analysed
indeed current mutation screening tests based hotspot codons 12 13 likely result mis-classification up one-third patients
although mutations codons 19 117 164 relatively rare events our data suggests k-ras mutation may differentially influence treatment response
we would therefore recommend adoption comprehensive k-ras mutation profiling least routine inclusion codon 146 mutation patient selection cetuximab related therapies
current data cosmic database summarises literature data ongoing sanger cancer-genome project describes 29 k-ras colorectal tumour mutations outwith codons 12 13 61 more 11?800 mutations hotspot codons ( http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/cgp/ ) but does not describe associated phenotypes
consistent our own data codon 146 most frequently mutated mutations described
k-ras codon 146 mutations been described human colorectal tumour cell line ( higashi et al 1990 ) mice thymic lymphomas ( sloan et al 1990 ) single human colorectal tumour case report ( orita et al 1991 )

consistent our own data tyner et al (2009) reported oncogenic phenotype associated k-ras 146 mutation leukaemia loupakis et al (2009) recently reported patient metastatic colorectal cancer k-ras 146 mutation resistant cetuximab
there only single report k-ras codon 19 mutations human colorectal tumours ( akagi et al 2007 ) vitro elevation active ras-gtp levels anchorage-independent growth increased tumourigenicity nude mice demonstrated
codon 19 mutation additionally been described h-ras human pituitary carcinoma metastases ( pei et al 1994 )
there two recent reports codon 117 mutations ? first k-ras human colorectal tumours ( wojcik et al 2008 ) second h-ras associated activation ras?mapk pathway mental retardation costello syndrome ( denayer et al 2008 )
interesting note costello syndrome been associated increased cancer predisposition ( gripp 2005 )
there no reports k-ras 164 mutations mutations codon not identified sanger cancer genome project investigators
recent clinical data convincingly associates response anti- egfr therapies k-ras mutation status patients metastatic colorectal cancer where logically response preferentially observed k-ras wt tumours ( lievre et al 2006 benvenuti et al 2007 khambata-ford et al 2007 freeman et al 2008 karapetis et al 2008 ramos et al 2008 loupakis et al 2009 van cutsem et al 2009 ) retain ability respond egfr blockade
our description k-ras gene amplification subset wt tumours particular interest regard increased k-ras gene copy number may lead more active ?mutation'-like phenotype
experiments investigate possibility currently underway our laboratory
interesting note our transcription profiling analysis revealed some similarities but many marked differences gene expression following introduction individual k-ras mutants
we found codon 117 common codon 146 mutations cluster previously described activating mutations codons 13 61 highlighting differences individual mutation phenotypes
our analysis k-ras induced gene expression identified number genes previously associated k-ras signalling example mapk dual specificity phosphatases dusp4 dusp6 
dusps key regulators balance between kinase pathway activation inactivation previously been reported upregulated adaptive response creating negative feedback loop following mapk pathway activation ( keyse 2008 )
consistent our own data dusp4 expression previously been shown increased pancreatic tumours k-ras mutations ( yip-schneider et al 2001 ) dusp6 expression increased variety tumour types mutations ras raf pathway genes ( croonquist et al 2003 warmka et al 2004 bloethner et al 2005 )
particular interest however our observation certain signalling cascades including those mediated igf1 vegf differentially activated cluster 1 cluster 2 k-ras mutants suggesting not only presence but specific molecular characteristics individual k-ras mutations may important determinants both tumour progression treatment response
example recent data suggests glucose deprivation promote acquisition k-ras mutations human tumours reports upregulation glucose transporter glut-1 k-ras mutant tumours ( yun et al 2009 )
our data confirms hypothesis but shows glut-1 induction restricted codon 12 13 61 117 mutations no change glut-1 expression associated introduction codon 19 146 164 mutations again reflecting phenotypic heterogeneity
current clinical data sufficiently compelling k-ras mutation testing facilitate selection patients most likely benefit anti- egfr therapy increasingly recommended clinical practise ( mcneill 2008 van krieken tol 2009 ) resulted recent formal recommendation national comprehensive cancer network patients k-ras tumour mutations should not treated cetuximab panitumumab ( mcneill 2008 )
there increasing interest identification prognostic molecular markers may used select most appropriate patients adjuvant chemotherapy identify colorectal cancer patients increased risk disease progression
although clinical implications non-hotspot k-ras mutations requires further validation both prognostic markers therapeutic targets our data suggests future analysis k-ras mutations quantitation mutation burden colorectal tumours should not limited previously described mutation hotspots should additionally consider unique molecular signatures associated individual k-ras mutations
