warburg phenotype cancer cells been long recognized but there still limited insight consecutive metabolic alterations characterize its establishment
we obtained better understanding coupling between metabolism malignant transformation studying mouse embryonic fibroblast-derived cells loss-of-senescence h-rasv12/e1a-transformed phenotypes different stages oncogenic progression
spontaneous immortalization induction senescence-bypass only marginal effects metabolic profiles viability
contrast h-rasv12/e1a transformation initially caused steep increase oxygen consumption superoxide production accompanied massive cell death
during prolonged culture vitro cell growth rate increased gradually along tumor forming potential in vitro anchorage-independent growth assays vivo tumor formation assays immuno-deficient mice
notably glucose-to-lactic acid flux increased passage number while cellular oxygen consumption decreased
conversion metabolic properties associated change mitochondrial nad+/nadh redox indicative decreased mitochondrial tricarboxic acid cycle oxphos activity
high rate oxidative metabolism newly transformed cells marked contrast high glycolytic rate cells later tumor stage
our experimental system cells growing under ambient oxygen conditions nutrient-rich media shift towards warburg phenotype occurred step-wise adaptation process associated augmented tumorigenic capacity improved survival characteristics transformed cells
we hypothesize early-transformed cells potentially serve founders new tumor masses may escape therapies aimed metabolic inhibition tumors fully developed warburg phenotype
carcinogenesis multi-step process not only involves activation oncogenes and/or inactivation tumor suppressor genes [ 1 ] but alterations energy metabolism
growth viability malignant cells strongly dependent their ability adopt altered metabolic profile fulfills synthetic bioenergetic requirements fast uncontrolled growth
metabolic phenotype characterized shift oxidative phosphorylation (oxphos) towards aerobic glycolysis main source atp production phenomenon first described otto warburg [ 2 ]
increased dependency cancer cells aerobic glycolysis well-recognized hallmark [ 3 ] but still relatively little known about factors control during early phases transformation process
issue whether not metabolic phenotype absolute prerequisite advanced cancer progression subject debate [ 4 ]
carbohydrate metabolism must warrant sufficient supply atp cell growth but maximize macromolecular biosynthesis [ 5 ]
intriguingly cancer cells develop ability escape senescence apoptosis processes glycolysis mitochondrial pathways actively engaged [ 6 ]
furthermore tumor cells maximize antioxidant capacity via glutathione system coupled increased flux through glycolysis-coupled pentose phosphate pathway (ppp) [ 7 ]
question why tumor cells relatively high glycolytic rate compared oxphos activity therefore goes well beyond basics two processes more efficient terms atp production
carbohydrate metabolism been studied extensively context oncogene-induced cellular signaling mutations metabolic enzyme-encoding genes themselves rarely direct cause cancer [ 8 ]
example increased glycolysis triggered activation pi3k/akt signaling pathway [ 5 9 ] p53 pathway [ 10 ]
important aspect been less well studied how metabolism changes dynamically transforming cell population
warburg phenotype solid tumors vivo thought result multiple adaptive changes metabolism response both cell-internal -external cues
hence conversion dysplasic cell towards full-blown cancerous state [ 11 ] not just caused genetic changes alone
step-wise development associated metabolic adjustments patient tumor cells difficult monitor virtually impossible obtain population founder cells tumor originally evolved
we therefore developed populations mouse embryonic fibroblasts (mefs) investigate how adaptations glycolytic-mitochondrial capacity accomplished during oncogenic transition
specifically we studied cells immortalized state directly after oncogenic transformation mutant h-rasv12 e1a
latter cells followed during step-wise conversion fully cancerous state vitro passage through immune-deficient mice vivo gave us opportunity analyze metabolism broad window tumor stages
we focused sequential order adaptations glycolytic-mitochondrial capacity accomplished under constant extrinsic conditions culture medium oxygenation
our data show sharp increase oxygen consumption high rate formation reactive oxygen species (ros) directly after h-rasv12/e1a transformation smooth transition towards higher glycolytic rates later during tumorigenic development
we hypothesize immediate increase oxygen consumption oxphos activity sets new delicate balance cell fate specification driving cells "adapt-or-perish" regime
subsequent escape situation associated gain survival characterized glycolytic switch even under ambient oxygen levels adaptation typical warburg phenotype
we set up new cell model system study metabolic characteristics immortalized tumorigenic cells all derived one defined genetically stable founder cell population mouse embryonic fibroblasts (prim-mef table 1 )
immortalized cells fulfill one early hallmark cancer namely limitless replicative life span [ 1 ]
spontaneously immortalized population (imm-mef) established passaging pool prim-mefs through replication bottleneck [ 12 ]
transition likely associated random acquisition one more genetic alterations such mutation p53 loss p19arf [ 13 ]

we used principle establish mef populations different phases oncogenic transition towards malignant phenotype via retroviral transduction plpc-e1a-ires-h-rasv12 prim-mef cells passage 2
resulting cell pool studied (i) directly after selection vitro cultivated cells (ras- l ow p assage: 5?10) (ii) after prolonged passage vitro (ras- h igh p assage: > 25) (iii) after injection ras-hp (p25) cells subcutaneously flank immune-deficient mice re-establishment tumor cell populations in vitro culture (ras-tum between +3 +10 passages after re-culturing)
population propagated mixed pool cells distinct viral dna integration sites genome possibly differences expression levels transforming transgenes
thus we avoided clonal analyses excluded possibility one few selective integrations transgene would dominate phenotypic outcome
cell morphology prim-mef imm-mef tbx2-mef populations largely similar but introduction h-rasv12/e1a induced prominent morphology changes resulted marked reduction cell diameter (table 1 additional file 1 : fig
s1 fig
s2a)
notably cellular protein concentration (additional file 1 : fig
s2b-c) decreased immortalized cells while tended increase h-rasv12/e1a transformed cells
effects immortalization h-rasv12/e1a expression growth rate studied
cell doubling rates prim-mef (between passage 3?8) tbx2-mef (between passage 15?25) did not differ (20 hrs table 1 ) but imm-mef (between passage 20?30) grew slower (+4 hrs)
doubling rate reduced three hours ras-lp cells eight hours ras-hp five hours ras-tum cells
our analyses revealed cultures ras-lp cells contained high percentage detached mostly dead cells culture medium assayed tryphan blue staining (fig

indicates we underestimated cell division time cells because reduced viability population
transition ras-lp ras-hp associated greatly improved survival chance drastic reduction amount non-adherent cells culture
we subsequently determined anchorage-independent growth characteristics our cell populations soft agar colony formation assays evaluated tumor forming potential immune-deficient mice
after nine days 5 7-fold more colonies formed ras-hp ras-tum soft agar assays compared ras-lp whereas imm-mef prim-mef tbx2-mef cultures gave no colonies all (table 1 )
subcutaneous injection cells immune-deficient mice revealed ras-hp-derived tumors four times larger ras-lp tumors after four weeks (table 1 )
we conclude capacity h-rasv12/e1a-transformed cells form tumors increases cell culture passage number
viability ras-lp ras-hp cells standard culture conditions 
adherent non-adherent cells harvested after 72 hours culture stained using tryphan-blue counted
: data presented percentages total amount cells
***: p < 0.001 (n = 5)
ras-lp cultures contain relatively more detached cells medium majority dead
b : data presented (a) absolute counts (n = 5)
***: p < 0.001 (n = 5)
ras-hp cell cultures contain relatively absolutely more viable cells
because all analyses performed cells growing ambient oxygen condition nutrient-rich culture media we analyzed impact low (2%) oxygen levels cell growth survival soft agar under conditions where diffusion limitation restricts nutrient supply
under both high low oxygen tension colony forming capacity ras-hp cells soft agar higher ras-lp cells
however ras-lp cells cultured 2% oxygen formed 3-fold more colonies 21% oxygen whereas ras-hp formed only 1.3-fold more colonies 2% oxygen (fig
2a?b )
ambient environmental oxygen supply extrinsic parameter thus plays important negative role fate specification cells immediately after h-rasv12/e1a transformation

lowering external oxygen levels inras-hp soft agar cultures results only marginal 1.3-fold andnon-significant increase colony number showing glycolyticshift relatively glycolytic cells does not result largeincrease viability colony formation cells soft agar
we further concentrated question cell-intrinsic metabolic parameters play role h-rasv12/e1a-initiated tumor cell development
increased lactic acid production hallmark change intermediary metabolism tumor cells [ 15 ] we determined lactic acid levels culture medium 24 48 72 hours after seeding cells alongside cell counts (see above)
enabled calculation lactic acid production per average cell time interval analyzed (additional file 1 : fig

because protein content per cell not stable cells different size volume (additional file 1 : fig

ras-hp cells showed 2.8-fold reduced oxygen consumption compared ras-lp while oxygen consumption ras-tum cells reverted level found prim-mef cells
measurement maximum oxygen consumption after uncoupling fccp revealed mitochondria ras-lp cells function 66% their maximum respiratory capacity compared only 25% prim-mef immortalized cells (additional file 1 : fig

oxygen consumption all cell types almost completely blocked complex v inhibitor oligomycin (additional file 1 : fig

moreover oxygen consumption completely blocked complex iii inhibitor myxothiazol only marginally affected extracellular supplementation nadh indicating vast majority oxygen consumption occurred mitochondria not due membrane oxidase activity (additional file 1 : fig

verify findings independent setting allow direct calculation fmoles oxygen consumed we determined proton extrusion rate (indicative anaerobic glycolytic rate) oxygen consumption rate (indicative mitochondrial oxphos) cells adherent culture conditions using real time extracellular flux analysis [ 17 ]
accordance lactic acid production normalized proton production rate (ppr fig

analysis oxygen consumption rate adherent cells (ocr fig
3c ) real time showed drastically increased oxygen consumption ras-lp cells compared prim-mef again appeared diminished ras-hp ras-tum
thus h-rasv12/e1a transformation directly induced high oxphos activity gradually diminished during prolonged culture vitro passage through immune-deficient mice
shift balance between aerobic anaerobic metabolism may associated abundance several key enzymes glycolytic mitochondrial pathways altered metabolite flux through reactions [ 18 ]
table 2 additional file 1 (fig

setting cytosolic nad+/nadh ratio determines enzymatic rate gapdh reaction ldh reaction shuttling nadh towards mitochondria via malate-aspartate shuttle therewith important determinant pyruvate flux
we investigated alteration flux through glycolytic mitochondrial pathways associated changes enzymes determine nad+/nadh redox couple
cytosolic malate dehydrogenase (mdh1) levels two-fold higher h-rasv12/e1a transformed non-transformed cells
contrast mitochondrial mdh (mdh2) levels appeared similar all cell populations (table 2 additional file 1 : fig

furthermore expression level nampt key enzyme nad+ salvage pathway one main regulators total cellular nad level increased immediately after h-rasv12/e1a expression

steady state levels redox state pyridine nucleotides important indicators regulators cell state metabolic signaling activity [ 19 ]
we studied pyridine nucleotide levels hplc reveal adjustments balance between glycolysis oxphos indeed reflected changes steady-state levels total cellular atp nad+ nadh nadp nadph (see additional file 2 additional file 1 : fig

analysis showed 30?40% increase total cellular nad(h) (nad+ plus nadh) levels but not nadp(h) (nadp+ plus nadph) levels rasv12/e1a transformed populations relative unchanged total cellular atp level
unfortunately neither two hplc analysis methods used allowed reliable quantification nad+/nadh nadp+/nadph redox status due methodological constrains
more detailed information levels compartmentalization non-protein bound nad(p)h obtained autofluorescence microscopy [ 20 ]
nad(p)h signals majority nadh largely confined mitochondria nucleus
two three-fold brighter autofluorescence signals recorded mitochondria nuclei cells ras-hp ras-tum pools (fig

however quantitative interpretation finding may complicated deviant morphological appearance mitochondria two populations compared prim-mef cells
we therefore studied mitochondrial nad+/nadh redox state specifically concentrating relationship between autofluorescence levels complex i (ci) activity electron transport chain (etc) oxphos system parameter independent cell morphology
treatment ci inhibitor rotenone blocks nadh consumption elicits direct increase mitochondrial nadh level
measurement difference nadh fluorescence before after rotenone administration thus indicative fraction cellular nadh actually used turnover oxphos activity
fig
4b 4c convincingly show nadh-signal set point 66% maximum rotenone-value ras-lp compared 78?84% all other cell populations
results strongly suggest ras-lp cells intrinsic properties force them use larger fraction their nadh content flux through oxphos ras-hp ras-tum cells explaining relatively high oxygen consumption our ras-lp cells
ras-lp cells switched passage six galactose containing medium condition used further maximize flux through mitochondrial oxphos [ 21 ] initially grew slower died around passage fourteen (data not shown)
us observations suggest impossible reach high passage stage solely aerobic metabolism
ras-hp cells did not survive switch galactose containing medium died within few days indicating their aerobic metabolic capacity not sufficient meet cellular growth demands
final control our assays we forced use mitochondrial oxphos tbx2-mef cells subjecting them growth galactose/pyruvate medium 6 days

we performed comprehensive analysis sequential metabolic changes occur panel cell populations loss cell-cycle arrest increased tumorigenic potential
analyses gave us new insight relation between oncogenic transformation development typical warburg phenotype
direct relatedness different cell pools ? all pools derived same primary mefs ground state cell population ? gave us unique opportunity do comparative profiling highlight early-late order adaptive metabolic changes energy metabolism occur during solid tumor development
two genetically independent immortalization procedures only minor effects cell size morphology carbohydrate metabolism yielded metabolic phenotypes strong similarity original prim-mef cells
contrast h-rasv12/e1a transformation caused prominent change flattened spherical appearance smaller volume (see [ 22 ])
similar changes been reported before other transformed cell types [ 23 24 ]
one most conspicuous observations our study metabolic phenotype initially switched aerobic oxphos-based immediately after transformation
augmented oxphos rate ras-lp cells associated increased total cellular nad(h) levels altered mitochondrial nad+/nadh setpoint increased oxygen consumption increased superoxide production
we think oxphos induction early transformed cells may general concept precedes well-documented warburg effect shift aerobic glycolysis
initial switch aerobic metabolism been reported after oncogene-mediated transformation human mesenchymal stem cells [ 25 ] human epithelial cells [ 26 27 ] human breast cancer cells [ 28 ]
stage however difficult draw direct comparison between our findings mouse cells findings different human systems panels related human cells lines comparable our panel do not exist generated via use increasing numbers oncogenes [ 27 ]
future work involving analyses metabolic fate specification panels human cells mesenchymal epithelial progenitor-stem cell origin will therefore needed verify prediction high oxphos activity early transformed cells
importantly our results indicate environmental factors exert strong influence viability tumor cells during early phase transformation process
anchorage-independent growth capacity ras-lp cells increased under low oxygen conditions presumably direct suppressive effect high intrinsic "unbalanced" mitochondrial activity simply better coupling glycolytic-mitochondrial pathways
better explanation discrimination between possibilities detailed comparison relative mitochondrial glycolytic pathway activity cells colonies formed under ambient oxygen hypoxia would imperative
unfortunately such pathway analysis relatively small numbers cells soft agar situ currently technically not possible so we leave analysis future work
we may extrapolate findings vivo situation we would predict nutrient levels environment including oxygen levels may determine fate early dysplastic cells tissues
light our results we predict low oxygen hypoxia would enhance their capacity grow tumors already proposed model gatenby gillies [ 29 ]
later trajectory oncogenic transformation displayed our cell panel involved gradual shift towards higher anaerobic glycolysis rates over 20 passages vitro passage through immune-deficient mice accompanied clear gain survival ability
we demonstrate here pools cells progress towards tumorigenic phenotype go through distinct series adaptational changes
although metabolic rewiring may controlled specific mutations regulatory genes become dominant entire pool we consider more likely cell-intrinsic metabolic signaling mechanisms acting within windows set culture conditions (i.e
nutrient o2 supply) used our experiments drive gradual shift oxphos glycolysis
we draw conclusion because we observed similar stepwise drift metabolic phenotype parallel series cell populations independently derived mefs mice combined defect phosphotransfer enzymes ck-b ak1 [ 30 ]
point important note entire transition trajectory occurred continuous presence 21% environmental oxygen under constant medium conditions
strikingly h-rasv12/e1a expression only marginally affected protein expression levels glycolytic tca oxphos enzymes all stages after transformation implying altered flux rates dominate underlie observed metabolic effects
shift mitochondrial nad+/nadh ratio we observed support model ratio sets flux rate key metabolic reactions
adaptive changes mitochondrial function without further genetic programming may provide growth- survival advantage conferring resistance apoptotic cell death [ 31 ]
cells electron flow through etc enhanced glycolytic flux may perform best properties associated reduced ros production increased ros scavenging ability respectively
ros induced damage well-known factor cell viability control [ 7 ]
indeed h-rasv12/e1a cells mitochondria primary ros source we observed direct relationship between oxygen consumption superoxide production
indirect support relationship provided our finding glucose-galactose shift effects tbx2-mef cells
we would like emphasize mechanisms other those based mitochondria-derived ros effects could explain apparent coupling between tumor progression increased glycolytic rate
firstly metabolic infrastructure cells could changed due ras-induced alterations cell morphology cytoarchitecture
cell surface changes cell clustering attachment movement processes coupled actin cytoskeleton rearrangements
bereiter-hahn co-workers [ 32 ] showed changes energy metabolism may result rearrangements f-actin network conversely energy demand motile actin-based structures supplied predominantly atp derived glycolysis
same time mitochondrial dynamics determined complex interplay between inner membrane-matrix complex cytoskeletal elements outside possibly via f-actin dynamin-related protein drp1 [ 33 ]
upregulation glycolysis alteration mitochondrial properties may thus directly coupled ras-induced cytoskeletal remodeling fulfill new needs development anchorage independent growth other essential prerequisites tumorigenic progression
another speculative possibility there may connection between cell cycle progression balance between glycolytic oxidative metabolism
h-rasv12 induces cell cycle progression via enhanced g1 s phase transition [ 34 ] e1a oncoprotein induces s-phase via induction p300/cbp c -myc [ 35 ]
recently reported slowly growing yeast cells low glucose environment exhibit periodic metabolic cycle alternates between glycolysis respiration where cell division cycle constrained reductive non-respiratory phase cycle dna replication taking place only during glycolytic phase [ 36 37 ]
extrapolation yeast model situation mammalian cells valid our findings may suggest glycolysis default metabolic pathway adapted ras-transformed cells enhanced proliferation capacity
finally our findings explained early alterations nad+/nadh setpoint acting driver subsequent changes tumorigenic conversion
we consider interesting possibility because we observed changes set point level nad(h) (nad+ plus nadh) metabolites upregulation nampt protein levels parallel immediate early effects h-rasv12/e1a transformation our ras-lp-hp-tum series
van der veer et al
[ 38 ] reported overexpression nampt results increased life span resistance oxidative stress
our data show total cellular nad(h) levels increase upon cellular transformation may relate simultaneous upregulation nad-salvaging enzyme nampt protein level
evidence now accumulating nad+ levels and/or redox state nad+/nadh couple cytosol nucleus mitochondria key factors transcriptional regulation [ 39 40 ] modulation growth-differentiation decisions dividing cells [ 41 ] survival control [ 42 ]
moreover need nad+ nadh essential co-factors regulation metabolic flux rates already long known
while we regard our work first proof-of-concept clear more study regulatory circuits ? including those human cells different tissue origin ? necessary draw definite conclusions about control over early late events warburg transition
we show h-rasv12/e1a transformation cells causes instantaneous dramatic upregulation mitochondrial etc-oxphos activity not aerobic glycolysis
brings newly transformed cells dangerous metabolic balance reflected high rate cell death
early stage cells limited capacity anchorage independent growth
based our findings we hypothesize cells then traverse "adapt-or-perish" period
those develop enhanced glycolysis relatively low mitochondrial activity increased survival chances adapt further commonly develop warburg phenotype tumorigenic cells
our data predict early-transformed cells high oxphos activity potential serve founders new tumor masses may missed positron emission tomography images escape therapies aimed metabolic inhibition tumors fully developed warburg phenotype
