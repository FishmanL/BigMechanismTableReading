presence kras braf mutations mutually exclusive
eocs pi3k mutation did not display braf kras mutations
thus pik3ca mutations mutually exclusive kras braf mutation
tp53 mutation analysis revealed mutation incidence rate 32.5% (50 154)
no significant associations found between tp53 mutations clinicopathological data like figo staging tumor grading tumor type patient age progression free survival
tp53 mutations not associated mutations pik3ca braf kras genes activation akt loss pten expression pik3ca amplification
using mouse monoclonal anti p53 antibody (table 1 ) p53 overexpression immunohistochemistry seen 68/138 (49.3%) eocs analyzed
p53 overexpression significantly associated p53 mutations ( p = 0.0002) trend increased expression noted poorly differentiated eocs ( p = 0.0961)
because suggested pik3ca mutations activate akt function through its phosphorylation [ 29 ] we investigated relationship between pik3ca mutation pik3ca amplification activation p-akt
correlation between activation akt clinicopathological parameters mutational status k-kras braf genes tp53 mutation explored
akt activation evaluated assessing phosphorylation akt immunohistochemistry ser473 eoc case considered show akt activation when scored 2+ 3+ p-akt ser 473
activation akt observed 52.1% (75 144) eoc cases
though p-akt ser 473 overexpression correlated significantly proliferation marker ki-67 expression ( p = 0.0262) no association seen clinicopathological parameters including progression free survival
there lack association between eocs harbored kras mutations braf mutations akt activation
all eoc cases lost reduced pten expression considered eocs pten inactivation
pten inactivation seen 33 144 (22.9%) eoc's analyzed associated histology subtype clear cell undifferentiated carcinomas ( p = 0.0491) overexpression p53 protein ( p = .0413) trend seen older age ( p = 0.0936)
no significant associations noted clinicopathological features various mutations analyzed
because pik3ca copy gain most common genetic alteration pi3k/akt pathway eocs middle eastern cohort we analyzed its relationship gene mutations pi3k/akt pathway
shown table 3 pik3ca gene copy gain uncommonly overlapped gene mutations eoc mutations mostly seen group eoc without pik3ca copy gain
mutual exclusivity between pik3ca copy gain any pik3ca kras braf mutations not statistically significant probably due small number mutations
there not single overlap among alterations
additionally majority amplified pik3ca cases harbored normal pten protein expression
however overlap between pten protein loss pik3a amplification seen number cases eoc (5.7% [4/140] data not shown)
summary individual cases eoc genetic alterations pik3ca braf kras genes similarities prevalence pi3k alterations western asian ovarian cancer [ 29 - 32 ] raised interest study alterations other ethnic groups
there mixed report incidence pik3ca mutation ovarian cancer
reported incidence pik3ca mutation epithelial ovarian cancer varies 3.6% [ 30 ] 12% [ 31 ]
our study showed lower incidence pik3ca mutations (3.9%) indicating pik3ca gene mutation not common mechanism activation pik3ca middle eastern ovarian tumors
earlier studies reported pik3ca gene amplification range 13 24.5% [ 10 - 13 33 ]
only one study done limited number ovarian samples (n = 12) reported higher incidence pik3ca amplification (40%) [ 9 ]
other hand our study demonstrated pik3ca amplification ovarian tumors relatively high frequency (35.5% fig
2 ) suggests major role pik3ca amplification activation ovarian cancers
interestingly there almost perfect reciprocal association presence gene amplification somatic pik3ca mutations suggesting mutations mainly occur tumors without amplification
agreement earlier report woenckhaus j et al 2007 we did not find any association between pik3ca amplification p110 ? protein expression [ 13 ]
lack association could explained transcriptional post transcriptional mechanisms finely tune expression level p110 ? expression
however we found p110 ? expression correlated p-akt ( p = 0.0260 table 2 ) trend noted proliferation marker ki-67 ( p = 0.0639)
next pten protein expression investigated immunohistochemistry 33 144 (22.9% fig
3 ) eocs showing pten inactivation concordance early report [ 34 ]
correlation analysis between pik3ca amplification pten protein loss ihc revealed majority pik3ca amplifications found cases high pten protein expression
data suggests single oncogenic alteration along pathway sufficient drive ovarian cell transformation
read out pi3k functional activation we tested akt phosphorylation (activation) eoc
our findings show akt activated large proportion eocs (52.1%) reflect activity pathway our eoc
however no significant association found between akt pik3ca mutation/amplification
currently multiple pathways been implicated having role akt activation such map kinase [ 35 ]
furthermore agreement earlier report [ 36 ] we found significant correlation between fatty acid synthase (fas) protein expression akt activation middle eastern eoc (data not shown)
therefore fas overexpression might one signaling pathways activate akt mechanism independent pi3k pathway
we interested studying relationship between pi3k/akt pathway p53 (tumor suppressor gene) since interactions between p53 pi3k/akt pathways play significant role determination cell death/survival
interrelation between pathways occurs through transcriptional regulation pten pik3ca p53 required p53 -mediated apoptosis [ 37 - 39 ]
p53 gene mutation among frequent genetic alteration ovarian carcinomas its incidence middle eastern eocs 32% relatively lower what been reported west (50 80%) [ 40 - 42 ]
recently astanehe et al 2008 suggested p53 inactivation results increases pik3ca transcripts beyond those result amplification pik3ca alone [ 37 ]
thus combined effects pik3ca amplification p53-mediated regulation pik3ca pten expression should contribute greatly increased signaling through pi3k pathway middle eastern eoc
we analyzed mapk signaling pathway investigating mutational status key genes pathway braf kras
presence kras braf mutations significantly more common serous borderline ovarian tumors compared serous carcinomas ( p = 0.0221 kras mutations) ( p < 0.0001 braf mutations) data not shown)
concordance earlier reports [ 16 17 ]
mutual exclusivity braf kras mutations (table 3 ) our ovarian carcinoma consistent previous findings ovarian carcinoma melanoma colorectal carcinoma [ 43 - 45 ]
supports view braf kras mutations equivalent effects tumorigenesis [ 44 - 46 ]
although possibility other downstream targets braf mutated conventional high-grade ovarian carcinomas cannot completely ruled out would appear development high grade serous carcinomas involves pathway distinct map kinase signaling pathway
examining relationship between pi3k/akt mapk pathways we found pik3ca amplification single most common genetic alteration our middle eastern eoc cases mutually exclusive gene mutations both pathways (pik3ca kras braf)
represents strong genetic evidence pik3ca amplification possesses similar oncogenic function classical gene mutations pathways ovarian cancer pathogenesis
collective prevalence genetic alterations (pik3ca amplification mutation pten protein loss) pi3k/akt pathway particularly high middle eastern eoc (60%) suggesting significant role pi3k/akt pathway pathogenesis eoc
our results showed though mutation pik3ca not common event eocs its amplification very common may novel mechanism activating pi3k/akt pathway some eocs
high prevalence pi3k/akt genetic alterations along low incidence kras braf mutations middle eastern ovarian carcinomas mutual exclusivity among genetic alterations pi3k/akt mapk pathways support notion dysregulated pi3k/akt pathways play important role pathogenesis ovarian cancers regardless ethnic background
understanding alternative molecular pathways result epithelial ovarian cancers will allow specific biological targeting therapy prevention ovarian cancer
