contrast cutaneous melanoma there no evidence braf mutations involved activation mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) pathway uveal melanoma although there increasing evidence pathway activated frequently latter tumours
study we performed mutation analysis ras braf genes panel 11 uveal melanoma cell lines 19 primary uveal melanoma tumours
addition western blot immunohistochemical analyses performed downstream members mapk pathway order assess contribution components
no mutations found any three ras gene family members only one cell line carried braf mutation (v599e)

data suggest activation mapk pathway commonly involved development uveal melanoma but occurs through mechanism different cutaneous melanoma

11 uveal melanoma cell lines under study only one cell line (ocm 1) carried braf mutation common v599e (also described calipel et al kilic et al )
all primary tumour specimens wild type braf 
no mutations found nras hras kras genes both cell lines primary tissue
order assess level expression activation (by phosphorylation) members mapk pathway downstream ras braf western blot analysis performed uveal melanoma cell lines ( table 2a )
expression levels downstream members ras braf presented figure 1 
response constitutively activating braf mutation ocm 1 downstream members mapk pathway show activation (phosphorylated mek erk elk)
levels expression downstream members not different two cell lines derived same primary tumour (92.1 92.2) except phosphorylated mek indicating there been little clonal divergence between cell populations during vitro culturing
interestingly compared phosphorylation status members ocm 1 most cell lines show activation mek erk elk however cell lines show activation absence mutations upstream ras braf genes
levels total erk remarkably similar across all cell lines exception two cell lines mel 285 mel 290 significantly higher levels total erk others
keeping observation two cell lines highest levels phosphorylated-erk
figure 2 shows there no significant influence serum activity erk1/2 cell lines reported recently calipel et al (2003) 
immunofluorescence results total phospho-erk1/2 panel 19 fresh frozen uveal melanoma sections listed table 2 (b) 
seven 19 primary tumours less 5% tumour cells stained positively erk1/2 nine tumours phosphorylated erk1/2
despite lack mutations ras braf genes set uveal melanomas noteworthy we observed phosphorylated (active) erk1/2 expression 10 19 tumours
there no significant association between erk1/2 activation tumour location cell type
scoring system antibody cannot compared between antibodies since antibodies recognise different epitopes different affinities therefore staining intensity western immunohistochemistry relative only other samples particular antibody used
uveal melanoma cell lines primary uveal melanomas analysed our study only cell line ocm 1 carried mutation braf (v599e) thus confirming documentation mutation cell line calipel et al (2003) kilic et al (2004) 
similarly our observation complete lack braf mutations primary uveal tumours mirrors findings several recent reports ( cohen et al 2003 cruz et al 2003 edmunds et al 2003 rimoldi et al 2003 weber et al 2003 kilic et al 2004 )
table 3 contains summary published reports ras braf mutations well studies other members mapk pathway uveal melanomas
including results our study date not single braf mutation been found total 276 primary secondary uveal melanoma samples ( table 3 )
somewhat surprising therefore three out three uveal melanoma cell lines studied calipel et al (2003) carried v599e mutation braf especially since only one out 11 cell lines panel we analysed found mutation
taken together data suggest while braf mutation not required uveal melanoma development vivo such mutations confer cellular growth advantage hence selected occur cell lines cultured vitro 
our study none cell lines primary tumours carried mutations any three ras genes (n h k) finding consistent previous report ( soparker et al 1993 )
mutation data stark contrast cutaneous melanoma would appear suggest mapk pathway unlikely play significant role uveal melanoma development
however contrary western blot analysis immunohistochemistry we found substantial evidence activation mapk pathway absence serum majority uveal melanoma samples ? both cell lines primary uveal melanoma specimens
frequent mapk pathway activation uveal melanoma independent ras braf mutations been reported recently others ( rimoldi et al 2003 weber et al 2003 ) but mechanism unknown
recently interaction been found between mapk pten pathways both frequently activated parallel promote cutaneous melanoma development ( tsao et al 2004 )
tempting speculate mapk activation uveal melanoma may arise via crosstalk pi3k/pten/akt pathway possibly consequence mutation some its components (other pten not mutated tumour type)
thus mutation analysis pi3k akt gene families uveal melanomas seems warranted
interestingly graells et al (2004) demonstrated proangiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) frequently highly expressed uveal melanoma ( stitt et al 1998 sheidow et al 2000 ) could operate cutaneous melanoma survival factor through increasing mapk pi3k pathway activity
possible mapk activation such crucial requirement uveal melanoma development because similarly provides survival and/or antiapoptotic signals necessary tumour cell growth maintenance
although many uveal melanoma samples been studied braf nras mutations few been analysed mapk activation there implicit assumption pathway not involved uveal melanoma genesis
our study only study design providing mutation information all ras members expression data wide range participants mapk pathway
our data thus support notion activation mapk indeed involved development uveal melanoma but occurs via different mechanism(s) majority cutaneous melanomas
conclusion significant ramifications development rational therapies treat uveal melanoma implies general inhibitors pathway may still effective even though tumours do not mutations ras braf .
