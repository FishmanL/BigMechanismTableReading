lkb1/stk11 multitasking tumour suppressor kinase
germline inactivating mutations gene responsible peutz-jeghers hereditary cancer syndrome
somatically inactivated approximately 30% non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc)
here we report lkb1/kras mutant nsclc cell lines sensitive mek inhibitor ci-1040 shown dose-dependent reduction proliferation rate whereas lkb1 kras mutations alone do not confer similar sensitivity
we show subset nsclc sensitised mtor inhibitor rapamycin
importantly data suggest lkb1 / kras mutant nsclcs genetically functionally distinct subset further suggest subset lung cancers might afford opportunity exploitation anti-mapk/mtor-targeted therapies

resequencing known cancer genes series 87 nsclc cell lines ( http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/cgp/celllines/ ) found significant association lkb1 inactivating mutations kras mutations ( p =0.03)
association recently been confirmed independent study ( matsumoto et al 2007 )
association lkb1 inactivation clustering non-v600 braf mutations ( figures 1a b ) observed
lkb1 ras/raf/mek (mapk) signalling pathways linked through rheb when active activates mtor inhibits wild-type braf but not mutated form ( im et al 2002 garami et al 2003 karbowniczek et al 2004 )
recently shown inhibition raf1 (craf) activity rheb prevents heterodimerisation braf raf1 ( karbowniczek et al 2006 )
lkb1 mutations nsclc may therefore general requirement activation mapk cascade overcome suppression through rheb inhibition
interdependence suggests inhibition mapk signalling may constitute potential opportunity therapeutic intervention genetic subset nsclc ( figure 1c )
further explore potential nsclc lines known genetic backgrounds ( table 1 ) treated mek inhibitor ci-1040
figure 2a shows lkb1/kras mutant cell lines uniform enhanced sensitivity ci-1040 when compared wild-type cell lines lkb1 mutant lines kras mutant lines (labelled control cell lines figure 2b )
interestingly lkb1/brafg466v mutant cell line (cal12t) insensitive ci-1040 falls top cluster
mean relative proliferation rate calculated lkb1/kras mutant cell lines compared control cell line cluster statistically significant ( p <0.001 all ci-1040 concentrations >0 figure 2b )
lkb1/kras mutant cell lines mean ic50 value 5? ? m compared control cell lines mean ic50>10? ? m 
we next investigated importance mtor signalling genetic subtypes lung cancers under study
figure 2c shows inhibiting mtor using rapamycin more pronounced affect proliferation lkb1/kras mutant cell lines case sensitive cluster included lkb1/braf mutant cell line cal12t
ic50 lkb1/mapk mutant cluster significantly different control cluster (40?n m vs >100?n m p ?0.04)
dual inhibition mek mtor ( figure 2d ) leads statistically significant decrease proliferation rate lkb1/kras mutant cluster versus control cell lines ( p -value: ?0.01)
effect dual inhibition general did not reach statistical significance additivity nor being synergistic either cluster ( figures 2e f ) although highest concentrations (5? ? m ci-1040 10?n m rapamycin) lkb1/kras mutant cluster data consistent additive model
however may due combined toxic effects higher drug concentrations
confirm mek inhibition being achieved cells we carried out immunoblot analysis erk phosphorylated erk cyclin d1 levels 8 24?h following ci-1040 treatment ( figure 3a )
all cell lines levels phosphorylated erk decreased increasing ci-1040 concentration 8?h however wild-type cell lines both genes lkb1 mutant required higher concentrations ci-1040 prevent phosphorylation erk
effect mek inhibition cyclin d1 levels did not appear correlate genetic status interestingly kras mutant cell line nci-h2009 showed similar decrease phosphorylated erk perhaps greatest decrease cyclin d1 levels despite inhibitor having little effect proliferation
altogether data show effects mek inhibition phospho-erk driven presence absence kras mutation independent lkb1 mutation status whereas proliferation effects related lkb1/kras combined mutation status
there no correlation cyclin d1 levels enhanced sensitivity mek inhibition we carried out immunoblot analysis p70s6k phospho-p70s6k (thr-389) levels phosphorylation residue critical kinase function ( pullen thomas 1997 )
figure 3b shows ci-1040 treatment no effect total p70s6k protein levels however decrease observed phospho-p70s6k (thr-389) levels specifically lkb1/kras mutant cell lines
decrease phosphorylation correlated well observed ic50 genetic subset
figure 3c shows rapamycin treatment no effect cyclin d1 protein levels but potent effect phospho-p70s6k (thr-389) levels all cell lines regardless mutation status
here we report lkb1 inactivation kras activation non-small-cell lung cancer denotes functionally distinct set lung cancer display sensitivity single-agent treatment mek inhibitor ci-1040 rapamycin
been previously shown melanomas treatment ci-1040 caused dose-dependent reduction phospho-erk cyclin d1 protein levels brafv600e mutant cell lines but not nras mutant melanomas ( solit et al 2006 )
our results while showing dose-dependent reduction phospho-erk kras mutant nsclc cell lines show inhibition proliferation only subset both kras lkb1 mutations highlighting importance cross-talk pathways supporting genetic data co-occurrence two mutations non-random
dose-dependent decrease phospho-erk reduction proliferation rate did not result corresponding decrease cyclin d1 levels suggesting subset nsclc downstream effecter pathways may different brafv600e melanomas
effects reduced proliferation genetic subset may due reduction activity p70s6k downstream both mtor erk1/2 shown specific reduction phosphorylation thr-389 p70s6k lkb1/kras cell lines following mek inhibition
data further highlight importance cross-talk between pathways genetic subset
interestingly cal12t lkb1/braf mutant cell line insensitive ci-1040 yet sensitive rapamycin suggesting additional smaller genetic subset nsclc possibly highlighting difference non -v600 braf mutations found nsclc ( brose et al 2002 )
despite being sensitised ci-1040 rapamycin dual-agent treatment did not demonstrably additive synergistic effects lkb1/kras cell lines suggesting possible redundancy pathways
lack additivity may explained observation rapamycin potently inhibits p70s6k phosphorylation thr-389 therefore precluding any additional effect ci-1040 p70s6k activity further confirming redundancy pathways genetic subset nsclc
mutation status cancers been shown predict response targeted therapies exemplified efficacy egfr inhibitors egfr mutant lung cancer ( lynch et al 2004 paez et al 2004 )
data presented here suggest lkb1/kras mutated tumours genetic functionally distinct subset nsclc
further data suggest investigation subset lung cancers respect newer generation inhibitors mapk mtor signalling pathways may provide new opportunity investigation targeted therapeutics common adult malignancy.
