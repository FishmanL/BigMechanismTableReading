parathyroid adenomas constitute most common entity primary hyperparathyroidism although recent advances been made regarding underlying genetic cause lesions very little data epigenetic alterations tumour type exists
study we determined levels promoter methylation regarding four tumour suppressor genes apc rassf1a p16 ink4a rar-? parathyroid adenomas
addition levels global methylation assessed analyzing line-1 repeats
sample collection consisted 55 parathyroid tumours known hrpt2 and/or men1 genotypes
using pyrosequencing analysis we demonstrate apc promoter 1a rassf1a promoter hypermethylation majority parathyroid tumours (71% 98% respectively)
using taqman qrt-pcr all tumours analyzed displayed lower rassf1a mrna expression higher levels total apc mrna normal parathyroid latter largely conferred augmented apc 1b transcription levels
hypermethylation p16 ink4a demonstrated single adenoma whereas rar-? hypermethylation not observed any sample
moreover based line-1 analyses parathyroid tumours exhibited global methylation levels within range non-neoplastic parathyroid tissues
results demonstrate apc rassf1a promoter hypermethylation common events parathyroid tumours
while rassf1a mrna levels found downregulated all tumours investigated apc gene expression retained through apc 1b mrna levels
findings suggest involvement ras signaling pathway parathyroid tumorigenesis
additionally contrast most other human cancers parathyroid tumours not characterized global hypomethylation parathyroid tumours exhibited line-1 methylation levels similar normal parathyroid tissues
primary hyperparathyroidism (phpt) common endocrine disorder denotes tumorous enlargement one more parathyroid glands
while genetic background phpt been partly elucidated involvement epigenetic modifications remains unresolved
mutations hrpt2 (also known cdc73 ) men1 tumour suppressor genes two important genetic events propelling parathyroid tumorigenesis [1] ? [3] 
protein product hrpt2 parafibromin functionally linked canonical part wingless type (wnt) pathway [4] 
parafibromin part human polymerase associated factor complex (hpaf) required facilitating transcription elongation histone modifications [5] ? [6] 
furthermore parafibromin been shown associate wnt oncoprotein ?-catenin down-regulate c-myc oncogene transcription through direct binding c-myc promoter region supporting role parafibromin tumor suppressor protein inhibits wnt signaling [7] 
interestingly men1 product menin coupled wnt pathway demonstrated its epigenetic regulation axin2 expression profiling men1 knock-out mice [8] ? [9] 
broaden knowledge epigenetic events parathyroid tumour development we sought determine levels promoter methylation four tumour suppressor genes apc (adenomatous polyposis coli) p16 ink4a rassf1a (ras association domain family protein 1) rar-? (retinoic acid receptor-beta) all known widely hypermethylated various human cancers well exhibiting potential parathyroid tumour suppressor genes
apc mutations responsible autosomal dominant familial adenomatous polyposis (fap) syndrome [10] ? [11] found sporadic colorectal cancer well other tumour types such cancer thyroid mammary glands [12] ? [13] 
hypermethylation apc promoter 1a been demonstrated e.g
cancer colorectum breast lung [14] ? [15] 
furthermore loss apc immunoreactivity recently been implicated parathyroid malignant tumours [16] 
tumour suppressor protein p16ink4a regulates g1 s phase transition cell cycle through its inhibition interaction between cdk 4/6 cyclin d1
parathyroid tumours often demonstrate over-expression cyclin d1 thus making p16 ink4a gene interesting candidate promoter methylation assays since p16 ink4a inactivation might produce parallel oncogenic effects analogous cyclin d1 up-regulation [17] 
p16 ink4a gene mutations been sought parathyroid tumours due presence 9p21-pter deletions small subsets parathyroid adenomas however no mutations been demonstrated [18] 
rassf1a gene localized 3p21 epigenetically inactivated high regularity human cancers well endocrine tumours such pheochromocytomas follicular thyroid cancer [19] ? [21] 
interestingly rassf1a been shown down-regulate cyclin d1 expression addition its role ras-binding protein hypothetically making rassf1a gene potential candidate parathyroid tumour suppressor gene [22] 
rar-? member nuclear receptor superfamily main function convey retinoid signaling target gene transcription nucleus
rar-? promoter exhibit frequent hypermethylation various tumours instance breast- prostate cancer well malignant mesothelioma [23] ? [25] 
recently shown up-regulation oncogene c-myc increased levels rar-? promoter methylation prostate cell line suggesting events might directly indirectly coupled [26] 
finding particular interest c-myc over-expression been demonstrated parathyroid tumours [27] 
addition gene-specific hypermethylation global hypomethylation common characteristic human cancers [28] ? [29] 
line-1 (long interspersed nuclear elements-1) retrotransposons denote replicating repetitive elements constitute about 15% human genome
cpg sites within line-1 promoter region normally heavily methylated protect retrotransposon activation line-1 hypomethylation noted epigenetic event human tumourigenesis
example line-1 promoter hypomethylation common colon cancer retrotransposal insertion line-1 sequence been directly shown disrupt apc gene case colon cancer [29] ? [30] 
furthermore quantifying line-1 promoter methylation densities been shown reliable substitute global methylation assays [31] 
towards ends we quantified promoter methylation apc rassf1a p16 ink4a rar-? line-1 repeats series parathyroid tumours characterized hrpt2 men1 genotypes

rassf1a methylation ranged 8% (cad13) 80% (rad4) 54 out 55 (98%) tumours displayed methylation densities above 10% ( table 1 figure 2 )
three normal parathyroid samples presented almost no rassf1a promoter methylation additional non-tumorous controls consisting normal thymus leukocyte dna displayed low levels rassf1a methylation
case shpt1 however exhibited average methylation density 30.2% ( table 1 figure 2 )

study we demonstrate frequent hypermethylation apc rassf1a tumour suppressor genes majority parathyroid adenomas
rassf1a promoter hypermethylation led diminished rassf1a mrna levels parathyroid adenomas compared normal parathyroid tissues whereas apc gene expression retained through augmented expression apc 1b mrna regulated apc promoter 1b
addition based line-1 promoter methylation results parathyroid benign tumours found exhibit global methylation levels within range normal parathyroid tissues examined
apc gene expression regulated least two separate promoter regions named 1a 1b
hypermethylation promoter 1a been readily demonstrated various human tumours however our knowledge there no little evidence suggesting epigenetic inactivation apc promoter 1b through hypermethylation [33] 
hence purpose we focused solely apc promoter 1a regarding pyrosequencing analyses
our tumour panel hypermethylation apc promoter 1a found majority benign parathyroid tumours well one familial hrpt2 related case
results supported research colorectal tumorigenesis where promoter 1a methylation regarded early event readily detected small colorectal adenomas [33] 
furthermore study all 16 adenomas analyzed qrt-pcr displayed augmented apc 1b mrna levels compared normal parathyroid tissues strongly suggesting apc promoter 1b not epigenetically silenced tumours
parafibromin encoded hrpt2 vital part hpaf complex involved epigenetic modifications facilitating gene transcription been shown specifically regulate c-myc oncogene expression through binding directly c-myc promoter region [7] 
our results do not point towards specific correlation between apc promoter methylation hrpt2 gene mutations suggesting parafibromin may not play apparent role regulation apc promoter 1a methylation
however apc promoter 1a methylation displayed weak but significant correlation tumour suppressor men1 genotype all parathyroid tumours men1 mutations our panel displayed apc hypermethylation ranging 11.6?65.9% ( figure 2 )
interestingly men1 protein product menin recently been implicated epigenetic modifier axin2 component within wnt pathway well apc-associated protein [8] 
our study vaguely implies menin might regulate levels apc promoter methylation dna level parathyroid cells since cases men1 mutations general displayed higher levels methylation wild-type cases
further molecular studies needed investigate potential role menin dna regulator apc promoter methylation status addition its known role axin2 regulator through histone methylation
rassf1a promoter found hypermethylated nearly all parathyroid adenomas examined rassf1a gene expression levels considerably reduced adenomas compared normal parathyroid tissue
data strongly support involvement tumour suppressor gene parathyroid tumorigenesis
unrelated tumour tissues rassf1a promoter methylation been shown greatly diminish levels rassf1a mrna transcription subsequent usage demethylating agents such 5-aza-cdr reconstitutes rassf1a transcription levels [34] 
role rassf1a cyclin d1 posttranslational modifier motivated us correlate our methylation data previous cyclin d1 expression results parathyroid cystic adenomas published elsewhere [35] 
however no statistical correlation between increased rassf1a promoter methylation density over-expressed cyclin d1 levels seen (data not shown) suggesting rassf1a hypermethylation least part might contribute excessive parathyroid tumour growth other means cyclin d1 accumulation example through its role regulator apoptosis mitotic arrest [19] 
regarding apc we demonstrate three cases normal parathyroid tissue (normal pt1-3) well case secondary hyperparathyroidism hyperplasia (case shpt1) displaying virtually no cpg promoter methylation suggesting methylation locus might conserved true tumorous lesions parathyroids such adenomas carcinomas
moreover studies shown normal adrenal well normal colonic mucosa general shows apc promoter 1a methylation levels below 5% compared higher levels observed corresponding tumours [20] [32] 
vast majority cases normal breast lung tissue display un-methylated apc promoter 1a compared corresponding tumours [15] [36] consequently examples illustrate tumour-specific phenotype apc promoter 1a methylation some tissue types
rassf1a three normal parathyroid samples endowed virtually no methylation (2.0% 3.6% 3.0% respectively) whereas case shpt1 endowed methylation density approximately 30% suggesting rassf1a methylation found parathyroid tissue disproportionate growth pattern albeit not tumour per definition
interestingly cyclin d1 over-expression found fraction cases secondary hyperparathyroidism suggesting subset lesions propelled parts processes similar those present parathyroid adenomas carcinomas [37] 
hence finding rassf1a hypermethylation case shpt1 could imply process could contribute pathological growth secondary hyperparathyroidism addition adenomas
other non-neoplastic endocrine tissues such normal adrenal medulla normal thyroid tissue rassf1a promoter habitually exhibit low levels (<10%) methylation densities few exceptions [20] ? [21] 
our study normal thymus leukocyte dna used additional controls displayed low levels rassf1a methylation validating specificity our findings
furthermore tumour case our study displayed virtually no rassf1a promoter methylation (cad13 8%) suggesting parathyroid tissue not routinely exhibit high levels methylation locus
not known whether hypermethylation apc promoter 1a bears any pathological consequences parathyroid growth since apc protein expression been previously demonstrated parathyroid adenomas [16] [27] 
however recent study shown reduced apc promoter 1a mrna levels colorectal tumours apc promoter 1a hypermethylation although retained apc protein expression through promoter 1b activity authors advocate even slight decrease apc gene transcription through epigenetic silencing promoter 1a could impact wnt signalling although via unknown mechanisms [33] 
furthermore another study regarding colorectal cancer found no correlations between apc methylation levels apc protein expression [38] 
study we found notably augmented levels total apc mrna levels (from promoters 1a 1b) well apc 1b mrna adenomas investigated qrt-pcr 13 out 16 samples displayed apc promoter 1a hypermethylation ( figure 4 )
data imply apc 1b mrna highly expressed parathyroid adenomas suggesting apc promoter 1b not epigenetically inactivated cases
presents credible explanation fact parathyroid adenomas display retained apc protein expression demonstrated previous publications although possibly endowed apc promoter 1a hypermethylation [16] [27] 
furthermore finding elevated levels total apc mrna most likely result elevated levels apc 1b mrna expression does not argue directly against theoretical specific down-regulation apc 1a mrna latter observed phenomenon colon cancer research [33] 
studies unrelated tumour tissues apc promoter 1a methylation coupled down-regulation apc 1a mrna treatment demethylating agents results re-expression specific transcript demonstrating sensible correlation between apc promoter methylation apc mrna transcript levels vivo [39] 
line-1 bisulphite pyrosequencing analysis been shown efficient substitute global methylation assays [31] our data thus suggests parathyroid tumours display comparable methylation levels globally normal parathyroid cells
finding unexpected considering current notion human cancers generally exhibit global hypomethylation
support our findings current study recently demonstrated global hypermethylation patients myelodysplastic syndrome (mds) compared normal controls using line-1 pyrosequencing [40] 
authors furthermore observed noteworthy clinical improvement among mds patients when treated hypomethylation-inducing agents suggesting global hypermethylation clinical significance tumour type
hence data suggest not all tumours display relative hypomethylation globally compared their corresponding normal tissues
addition we found male cases displayed significantly higher levels line-1 methylation female cases (pearson's correlation ?0.466 p<0.001) cases higher age surgery displayed lower levels line-1 methylation younger cases (pearson's correlation 0.320 p?=?0.018)
observations may suggest influence age gender upon global levels methylation parathyroid tissues
summary study first identify apc rassf1a promoter hypermethylation majority parathyroid tumours investigated
frequently observed hypermethylation rassf1a promoter downregulation rassf1a mrna levels parathyroid adenomas point toward association between inactivation tumour suppressor gene parathyroid aberrant growth whereas apc gene expression retained parathyroid adenomas due increased transcription apc promoter 1b
moreover line-1 analyses indicate parathyroid tumours do not exhibit global hypomethylation compared normal parathyroid tissues
