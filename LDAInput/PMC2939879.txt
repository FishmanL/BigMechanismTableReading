queen conch ( strombus gigas ) reproduction inhibited nearshore areas florida keys relative offshore environment where conchs reproduce successfully
nearshore reproductive failure possibly result exposure environmental factors including heavy metals likely accumulate close shore
metals such cu zn detrimental reproduction many mollusks
histology shows gonadal atrophy nearshore conchs compared reproductively healthy offshore conchs

normalized cdna library queen conch constructed sequenced using 454 life sciences gs-flx pyrosequencer producing 27723 assembled contigs 7740 annotated transcript sequences
resulting sequences used design microarray
microarray analysis conch testis indicated differential regulation 255 genes (p<0.01) nearshore conch relative offshore

gene ontology enrichment analysis indicated changes biological processes: respiratory chain (go:0015992) spermatogenesis (go:0007283) small gtpase-mediated signal transduction (go:0007264) others
inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry analysis indicated zn possibly cu elevated some nearshore conch tissues
congruence between testis histology microarray data suggests nearshore conch testes regress during reproductive season while offshore conch testes develop normally
possible mechanisms underlying testis regression observed queen conch nearshore florida keys include disruption small gtpase (ras)-mediated signaling testis development
additionally elevated tissue levels cu (34.77 ng/mg testis) zn (831.85 ng/mg digestive gland 83.96 ng/mg testis) nearshore similar reported levels resulting reproductive inhibition other gastropods indicating metals possibly contribute ns conch reproductive failure
queen conch ( strombus gigas ) species significant ecological economic importance throughout its range
example estimated economic value annual conch fishery bahamas approximately $4.457 million representing 9800 seasonal jobs [1] 
queen conch large benthic invertebrate associated coral reef ecosystems therefore could serve indicator species toxic effects contributing decline florida coral reef ecosystem
result queen conch population decline florida complete moratorium florida conch fishery declared 1986 [2] [3] 
queen conch listed under convention international trade endangered species' (cites) appendix ii 1992 [4] 
however recovery adult conchs spawning aggregations within florida keys been modest
2001 number adult conchs offshore (os) spawning aggregations estimated 27000 up lowest observed estimate 5750 1992 according transect data collected florida fish wildlife conservation commission [3] 
believed little no reproduction occurs nearshore (ns) aggregations might contribute slow recovery population [2] [3] 
study conch reproduction found ns conchs failed develop adequate gonad tissue reproduction but translocation ns conchs os environment resulted development normal gonad tissue reproductive activity within three months [2] 
however causes reproductive failure ns conchs remain unknown
human impacts coastal marine ecosystems ever-increasing threats include inputs nutrients organic contaminants metals well changes temperature decreasing ocean ph deoxygenation [5] 
while many factors theoretically affect reproduction one plausible cause reproductive failure ns marine gastropod heavy metal exposure
number gastropod studies related heavy metal exposure particular exposure cu [6] - [8] zn [6] [9] [10] reduced fecundity ? reproductive output usually measured terms egg laying
despite link between exposure cu zn decreased reproductive output gastropods past studies consider mostly female-mediated effects individual level
florida keys both male female reproductive development inhibited ns [2] [3] 
given heavy metals known inhibit gastropod egg laying general point sources metal contamination exist close shore florida keys [11] ? [13] our general hypothesis heavy metals likely contribute reproductive failure observed ns
present study our specific hypotheses were: testis transcriptional data would identify candidate gene expression pathways affected ns environmental stressors tissue concentrations heavy metals ns conchs would exceed those os conchs
study we developed used microarray identify gene expression differences between testes ns os conchs
gene expression data anchored histopathology provide more complete understanding dysfunction testis development ns conchs
additionally we used inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry quantify nine metals including cu zn conch tissues determine whether their concentrations correlate histological gene expression evidence ns reproductive dysfunction

gene expression analysis conch testis reveals logically spermatogenesis-associated transcripts down-regulated ns
correspondingly mitochondrial transcripts significantly down-regulated ns testes
effects proton transport identified go enrichment analysis could either cause result observed reduction spermatogenesis ns testes given important role mitochondria spermatozoa sperm maturation [28] ? [30] 
our finding likely result reduction mature spermatozoa consequent numeric reduction mitochondria ns testes opposed os
under biological process go:0007283 spermatogenesis we identified differentially regulated transcripts major roles spermatogenesis species ranging drosophila humans including degenerative spermatocyte homolog 1 (degs1) [31] similar kiser (homologous slowmo) [32] proteasome activator subunit 4 (psme4/pa200) [33] dnaj related subfamily b member 13 (dnajb13) [34] [35] related tsarg genes rats [36] mice [37] nuclear autoantigenic sperm protein (histone-binding) (nasp) [38] 
genes important process spermatogenesis wide range species appear conserved queen conch all down-regulated ns present study
surprising result go enrichment analysis enrichment term ?small gtpase-mediated signal transduction.? most genes under term related ras-gtpases proto-oncogenes involved mammalian tumor formation developmental disorders [39] 
seven genes fall under go term differentially regulated our experiment including related ras viral oncogene homolog (rras) ras related protein 1b (rap1b) rab1a member ras oncogene family t-cell lymphoma invasion metastasis 1 (tiam1) rab member ras oncogene family 4-like (rabl4) adp ribosylation factor-like 1 (arl1) 4r79.2 hypothetical gtp-binding protein identified caenorhabditis elegans 
all genes down-regulated exception tiam1 ( table s2 )
ras function been described invertebrates including ascidians ras signaling involved embryonic tissue development [40] drosophila rap1 involved cell adhesion polarity during epidermal growth factor receptor-mediated tissue growth [41] 
ras genes known involved vertebrate invertebrate testis development
ras-cyclin d2 pathway involved mouse spermatogonial stem cell development vitro [42] 
mapk rap-gef signaling pathways involved testis development renewal drosophila [43] 
therefore ras-gtpase signaling may play major role conch testis tissue growth differentiation
histological si correlated six 11 differentially regulated transcripts involved spermatogenesis small gtpase-mediated signaling ( table 7 )

transcripts evaluated real-time rt-pcr selected based their differential regulation between ns os according microarray study ( table s2 ) their varied interesting biological functions
go biological processes gene products include: ctr1c copper transmembrane transport tepii antibacterial humoral response gst glutathione metabolic process stard7 no biological process (but related steroidogenic acute regulatory (star) protein)
results our real-time rt-pcr assays largely successful validating changes observed microarray study
tepii gst stard7 confirmed real-time rt-pcr though gst result not statistically significant
ctr1c however essentially unchanged between ns os samples real-time rt-pcr 1.03-fold change direction opposite determined microarray
difference results between platforms possibly due part small sample size (n?=?4) used both assays increased sample size would lend power analyses
unfortunately permitting regulations limit sample size protected species such s
gigas 
possible ctr1c our probe designed region homology other proteins isoforms slc31 family copper transporters causing lack consistency between microarray real-time rt-pcr
changes tepii gst stard7 may indicate stressors affecting ns conchs cause changes immune response xenobiotic metabolism/redox balance steroidogenesis respectively
however single gene changes so should interpreted carefully
our icp-ms data indicated cu zn two known reproductive toxicants gastropods elevated some ns conch tissues
our study included other analytes known toxic effects including ni ag cd sn hg u
sr included due its role shell-building known physiologically beneficial gastropods low doses but toxic high levels [44] 
however few differences observed latter seven analytes
effects cu zn gastropod reproductive output been well-documented although most examples relate females
laboratory exposures cu resulted reduced fecundity helix aspersa [6] reduced egg-laying dose-dependent reduction hatching pomacea palludosa [7] copper oxychloride reduced oocyte number ovotestis helix aspersa [8] 
zn exposures likewise impacted reproduction numerous studies resulting reduced fecundity population growth rate valvata piscinalis [10] reduced fecundity helix aspersa [6] effluent containing zn cd fe mortality reduced egg laying lymnaea palustris [9] 
general point sources heavy metals south florida include storm water runoff roadway contaminants septic system leachate boats may responsible high levels hg pb zn cu waterways [12] 
elevated cu zn cr hg pb ni levels been identified biscayne bay adjacent city miami well outflow canals [11] 
additionally heavy metals including cu zn been detected sediments seagrass beds both habitats occupied conchs well surface waters multiple sites throughout south florida cu sometimes exceeding guidelines aquatic life sediment quality [13] 
taken together information suggests potential sources cu zn contamination exist florida keys likely primarily land close shore further supporting plausibility metals interfering ns testis development
present study zn elevated digestive gland possibly gonad ns conchs ( figure 5a )
coupled knowledge zn causes reduced fecundity other gastropod species [6] [9] finding suggests zn may contribute reproductive failure ns conchs
observed ns digestive gland mean concentration 831.85 ng zn/mg tissue similar body burden observed (approx
200?500 µg zn/g tissue) effluent treatments resulting mortality reduced fecundity lymnaea palustris [9] 
while available data literature focus female-mediated reproductive inhibition measured reduced fecundity studies fecundity may miss mechanistic effects both males females
further while gonad apparent site action any potential toxicant accumulation zn digestive gland present study likely significant finding
digestive gland adjacent gonad believed site metal accumulation detoxification gastropods [45] ? [48] 
while recent study indicates zn concentrations testis japanese eel anguilla japonica track progression spermatogenesis [49] important note excess zn external sources could still deleterious effect possible present study
relationship between zn spermatogenesis likely complex should subject further study
no significant differences cu concentrations within any tissue found between ns os
mean concentration 34.77 ng cu/mg tissue observed ns conch testis study still only fraction toxic levels accumulated studies rogevich et al
[7] (396.60 ng cu/mg tissue) snyman et al
[8] (260.47 ng cu/mg tissue) but approximately five times os mean 6.60 ng cu/mg tissue
further aforementioned studies measured whole body cu rather tissue-specific accumulation
blood levels cu our study (40.18 ng cu/mg tissue ns 58.90 ng cu/mg tissue os) highest any tissue would difficult separate cu contribution hemocyanin tissue amount actually bound up cells
other words blood cu bound hemocyanin might obscure differences between tissues
therefore cu might still factor ns reproductive failure future studies will attempt test possibility
should noted many environmental factors could considered stressors complex environmental mixture all real-world situations multiple stressors likely involved our ns sites
inverse correlations between cu zn concentrations digestive gland si ( table 7 ) provide support argument accumulation metals including zn possibly cu conch digestive gland affects development conch testis
hypotheses will examined future studies
approximately 60000 extant gastropods make up largest class within 100000-member phylum mollusca second-largest animal phylum [50] 
however very little work been done area gastropod genomics
pubmed search ?gastropod microarray? 16 july 2010 yielded only 14 results one non-germane
two remaining 13 papers discussed toxicogenomics tool understanding endocrine disruption invertebrates [51] [52] 
remaining 11 papers applied only five genera gastropods: helix [53] lymnaea [54] haliotis [55] aplysia [56] biomphalaria [57] [58] schistosomes use both humans gastropods hosts [59] ? [63] 
fielded search ?gastropoda[organism]? geo yielded only 13 results consisting two submissions here reported addition two platforms (gpl3635 gpl3636) two gene expression datasets (gse4628 gse18783) aplysia californica one platform (gpl7421) one gene expression dataset (gse13039) haliotis asinina two platforms (gpl9129 gpl9483) two gene expression datasets (gse16596 gse18705 gse22037) biomphalaria glabrata

still aside several heavily studied genera one ( biomphalaria ) direct importance human health entire realm gastropod genomics remains developed
study provided new information regarding reproductive failure ns conchs florida keys
major findings study include following: first failure ns conchs reproduce coupled reduction ns testis development previously reported [2] premature regression ns testis
second microarray results indicate reduced testis tissue ns male conchs concurrent decrease expression many genes related spermatogenesis mitochondrial function
transcription small gtpase-related signaling genes clearly affected may contribute lack testis tissue development but requires further study
finally study supports hypothesis heavy metals may contribute reproductive failure ns conchs
zn possibly cu elevated ns conch digestive gland zn may elevated testis
given zn cu known reduce gastropod fecundity possibility same metals may inhibit gametogenesis both males females merits further consideration
note study characterized effects ns environment reproductive tissue male conchs
while many gastropod reproduction studies rely egg-laying (i.e
female-mediated effects) measure average reproductive success [6] ? [10] phenomenon observed ns florida keys affects both males females [2] [3] 
conchs rely mate-pairing copulation [4] rather broadcast spawning other mating strategies would require fewer reproductive males
logically lack male reproductive maturity could significant impact conch population
future studies will aim assess transcriptional effects ovaries affected ns females addition males
although testicular regression ns conchs appears persistent problem florida keys apparently reversible level individual many ns conchs transplanted os areas become spawning capable [2] 
suggests transcriptional effects immediately transiently respond environmental factors play important role understanding disparity conch reproduction ns os well identifying responsible factors
therefore combination microarray studies more traditional approaches will yield useful information managers work facilitate recovery ns queen conch populations florida keys
