impact stability lkb1 mrna detecting lkb1 mutations tested using rt?pcr mrna extracted nsclc cell lines previously been characterised lkb1 mutations
included nci-h441 (wild type) a549 nci-h1395 nci-h23 nci-h2126 (all containing lkb1 mutations)
reverse transcriptase?pcr amplification whole coding region lkb1 mrna showed cell lines nonsense (a549 nci-h23) mutations 1?bp deletion (h1395) expressed mrna comparable size wild-type h441 cell line (1460?bp)
h2126 cell line known homozygous deletion exons 4?6 expressed mrna substantially smaller size (?1000?bp) corresponding deletion 398?bp
rt?pcr revealed no major difference lkb1 mrna expression levels between lkb1 mutant wild-type cell lines ( figure 1a )
lkb1 mutant wild-type cell lines expressed comparable amounts lkb1 mrna rt?pcr we studied cdna mutations using surveyor-wave method
wave hplc provides system analyse dna fragments smaller 900?bp therefore we designed two overlapping amplicons covering exons 1?5 (797?bp) 5?9 (702?bp) amplify whole coding region lkb1 mrna
pcr products lkb1 mutant cell lines mixed 1?:?1 products wild-type cell lines (h441) generate heteroduplexes lkb1 mutant cell lines previously reported homozygous inactivation gene
surveyor-wave analysis amplicon covering exons 1?5 revealed novel peaks cdna a549 nci-h1395 cell lines compared wild type nci-h441 ( figure 1b )
surveyor-wave analysis exons 5?9 showed novel peaks nci-h23 cell line well
mutations detected surveor-wave confirmed conventional dna sequencing corresponded previous reports ( sanchez-cespedes et al 2002 carretero et al 2004 )
we could not detect lkb1 mutation h2126 cell line surveyor-wave method using two-amplicon approach because cell line homozygous deletion exons 4?6 reverse primer first amplicon forward primer second amplicon lie deleted part gene (data not shown)
we next used surveyor-wave method screen nsclc tumour specimens ( n =310) lkb1 mutations
we detected 34 lkb1 mutations (11%) nsclc tumour specimens ( table 1 )
majority lkb1 mutations detected deletions insertions ( n =25 74%)
remainder missense ( n =7 21%) nonsense ( n =2 6%) mutations ( table 2 figure 1c )
about one-half deletions insertions small covering <15?bp ( n =14 56%) whereas larger deletions ( n =11 44%) covering hundreds base pairs detected remaining specimens
some mutational hotspots discovered
areas same mutation more one tumour specimen included deletion exon 4 ( n =4) deletion exons 2 3 ( n =3) d194y ( n =2) p281l ( n =2)
interestingly significant portion mutations located exon 1 ( n =11 32%) but there no area recurrent mutations exon ( table 2 )
missense mutations detected current study all except r426w kinase domain protein
missense mutations codons 176 194 been previously characterised pjs ( launonen 2005 )
we found four f354l alterations (data not shown) but we did not consider missense mutations alteration previously been reported rare polymorphism gene ( launonen et al 2000 )
we did not access corresponding normal tissues therefore we could not verify some missense mutations somatic germline
mutation frequency lkb1 gene significantly higher nsclcs caucasian cohort ( table 1 )
twenty-five (17% specimens) lkb1 mutations detected nsclcs collected patients united states whereas only nine mutations (5% specimens) detected korean cohort ( p =0.001) ( table 1 )
lkb1 mutation rate tended higher adenocarcinomas (13%) compared squamous cell carcinomas (5%) ( p =0.067)
differences histological subgroups relatively modest us cohort mutations 18 out 94 (19%) adenocarcinomas vs 5 out 38 (13%) squamous cell cancers ( p =0.461)
contrast findings asian patients where all lkb1 mutations detected adenocarcinomas (9 out 113 (8%)) none detected squamous cell cancers (0 out 54 (0%) p =0.032)
nevertheless higher rate lkb1 mutation adenocarcinomas compared squamous cell carcinomas retains same level statistical significance (stratified p =0.064) after adjusting fluctuation between ethnic groups
us cohort included nine specimens adenosquamous carcinomas two out nine (22%) lkb1 mutations similar frequency adenocarcinomas population ( table 1 )
there no association between lkb1 mutations clinical stage nsclc patients
kaplan?meier survival curves stages i ii nsclc patients showed tendency shorter survival patients lkb1 mutant tumours but however did not reach statistical significance ( p =0.17) ( figure 2 )
no differences survival observed patients who harboured both lkb1 kras mutations compared those kras lkb1 alone but total number patients both mutations who stages i ii nsclc small ( n =9 data not shown)
we detected association lkb1 mutations smoking history ( p =0.007) only two mutations detected tumours 72 nsclc patients who either never light (?10 pack years) former smokers ( table 1 )
after adjusting ethnic group higher rate lkb1 mutation among patients smoking history borderline significant (stratified p =0.067)
reduction statistical significance likely owing loss power associated overall rarity lkb1 mutations among never light former smokers
analyses we combined both never smokers light (?10 pack years) smokers frequency mutations other oncogenes such egfr similar two patient groups ( pham et al 2006 )
there no correlations between lkb1 mutations gender age patient
previous reports suggested nsclc cell lines lkb1 mutations often occur concurrently kras braf mutations ( sanchez-cespedes et al 2002 carretero et al 2004 )
furthermore egfr mutations often mutually exclusive kras mutations nsclc ( kosaka et al 2004 marchetti et al 2005 )
we used combined data previous papers ( sanchez-cespedes et al 2002 carretero et al 2004 ) sanger institute's databases ( bamford et al 2004 ) analyse association lkb1 mutations mutations kras braf egfr 
analysis lkb1 mutation harbouring nsclc cell lines (a-427 a549 nci-h1395 nci-h1666 nci-h2122 nci-h2126 nci-h23 nci-h460) showed five cell lines (63%) concurrent lkb1 kras mutations two (25%) concurrent lkb1 braf mutations only one (13%) neither kras nor braf mutations
none cell lines egfr mutations
our findings nsclc cell lines suggested concurrency kras braf mutual exclusiveness egfr mutations lkb1 mutations we analysed mutational status genes our primary nsclc tumour specimens
kras mutations detected 49 (16% whole tumour set 25% caucasian 8% asian specimens) tumour specimens 10 (20% kras mutants) occurring concurrently lkb1 mutation ( p =0.042) ( table 3 )
four braf mutations (1%) found tumour set (g465v n581s l596r t599i) one (n581s) occurred concurrently lkb1 mutation ( p =0.373)
seventy tumours (23% whole tumour set 9% caucasian 34% asian specimens) egfr kinase domain mutations only one them occurring concurrently lkb1 mutation ( p =0.002)
tumour concurrent egfr lkb1 mutation missense mutation lkb1 outside kinase domain (r426w)
no germ line dna available patient
however recent report suggested r426w fact rare polymorphism gene ( onozato et al 2007 )
taken together our findings suggest unlike kras mutations egfr lkb1 mutually exclusive nsclc
previous reports ( sanchez-cespedes et al 2002 carretero et al 2004 ) cancer genome project sanger institute ( bamford et al 2004 ) extensively characterised lkb1 mutations nsclc cell lines kras braf mutations but lkb1 status egfr mutant nsclc cell lines not been extensively analysed
therefore we analysed lkb1 genotype nsclc cell lines known egfr erbb2 mutations
twelve egfr mutant one erbb2 mutant cell lines analysed lkb1 genotype
no lkb1 mutations detected cell lines ( table 4 )
present study characterised lkb1 mutation frequency nsclc using one largest tumour sets date ( n =310)
our study analysed tumours different histologies both us korean origin determine potential histological ethnic variation lkb1 mutational frequency
large size our study enabled us study associations lkb1 mutations clinocopathological factors been incompletely characterised previous studies ( sanchez-cespedes et al 2002 carretero et al 2004 fernandez et al 2004 matsumoto et al 2007 onozato et al 2007 )
addition we used modification sensitive mutation screening technique we previously developed facilitate rapid detection lkb1 mutations ( janne et al 2006 )
findings our study confirm high frequency lkb1 mutations nsclc (11%) contrast rare (0?4%) other common solid malignancies ( avizienyte et al 1998 1999 )
reason behind observations presently unknown but might reflect differences carcinogen exposure lungs compared other tissues
support hypothesis we find lkb1 mutations significantly ( p =0.007) more common smokers never light (?10 pack years) cigarette smokers ( table 1 )
male pjs patients (age ?50 years) increased risk developing lung cancer compared general population but relationship smoking increased risk lung cancer pjs unknown ( hearle et al 2006 )
interestingly lkb1 mutation spectrum found current study very similar those previously published pjs (deletions 34% insertions 15% splice site mutations 14% missense mutations 21% nonsense mutations 12%) ( launonen 2005 ) pjs no clear mutational hotspots detected
our study demonstrated lkb1 mutation frequency significantly higher cancers derived us population compared those found korean patients (17 vs 5% p =0.001)
differences track cigarette smoking number never/light former smokers much higher korean cohort compared us cohort patients (38 vs 13%)
similarly recent study 100 japanese nsclcs found only 3% contained lkb1 mutation ( onozato et al 2007 )
findings contrast egfr mutations more frequently detected tumours never/light cigarette smokers asian patients ( janne johnson 2006 )
our studies further highlight ethnic environmental differences origins nsclc
given differences lkb1 mutation frequencies smokers vs never/light smokers us compared korean patients we further determined whether associated other oncogene mutations known vary subgroups patients
consistent prior studies we found significant association concurrent kras mutations common smokers ( ahrendt et al 2001 ) one out three nsclc lkb1 mutations ( table 3 )
contrast there significant inverse relationship lkb1 mutations egfr mutations both nsclc tumours cell lines not previously been described ( tables 3 4 )
differences may relate biological role lkb1 lung cancer
possible egfr mutant lung cancers there already maximal activation pi3k/akt/mtor signalling pathway thus lkb1 mutation may not required further potentiate signalling pathway
contrast kras mutant cancers concurrent lkb1 mutation may required enhance mtor activation
mice concurrent kras mutations lkb1 inactivation more aggressive tumours shorter survival those only kras mutant cancers ( ji et al 2007 )
our study we not able detect significant survival difference patients whose tumours contained lkb1 mutations alone concurrently kras mutations (data not shown) likely because limited number tumour specimens
additional studies needed clarify prognostic impact lkb1 mutations humans nsclc
present study ?2 out 3 lkb1 mutant tumours kras wild type ( table 3 )
one possibility such tumours contain concurrent mutation another oncogene activates same signalling pathway kras
reason we examined our tumours braf mutations found 1?2% nsclc ( naoki et al 2002 )
we detected concurrent lkb1 mutation one four braf mutant tumours ( table 3 )
tumour wild type kras (data not shown)
addition some braf mutant nsclc cell lines (nci-h1395 g469a nci-h1666 g466v) contain concurrent lkb1 mutation ( sanchez-cespedes et al 2002 bamford et al 2004 carretero et al 2004 )
future studies will help further clarify whether lkb1 mutations occur concurrently other genomic alterations nsclc impact patient outcome
our study employed mutation scanning technology screen lkb1 mutations cdna level ( janne et al 2006 )
advantageous entire coding region lkb1 could rapidly screened mutation using just two overlapping cdna fragments
lkb1 challenging gene analyse genomic dna level because its high guanine?cytosine content
addition many lkb1 mutations small deletions ( table 2 ) involve deletions entire exons would missed using exon-specific genome sequencing methods
our method however does limitations would miss deletions site pcr primers whole gene deletions deletions within promoter region all been infrequently detected pjs ( volikos et al 2006 )
thus our studies may underestimate true lkb1 mutation frequency nsclc
addition our method limited analysis fresh tumour specimens available only minority nsclc patients
furthermore techniques isolating mrna formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumour specimens continue improve rapid mutation scanning technique used analyse broader populations tumours nsclc patients
future studies may need employ combination lkb1 mutation detection methodologies including current method mlpa direct sequencing.
