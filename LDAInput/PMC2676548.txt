histological examination h&e sections showed primary xenografts adenocarcinomas features similar original surgical specimens exception oip17 grew sheets poorly differentiated cancer cells
seen figure 2 histological features more complex those typically seen xenografts established subcutaneous site cell lines been previously noted ( rubio-viqueira et al 2006 )
tumours tended moderately well differentiated mucin production
organised glandular structures prominent fibrovascular stroma some cases comprised bulk tumour
cellular dna content analysis flow cytometry confirmed many tumours normal mouse cells accounted >80% total cell population
immunohistochemistry phosphorylated akt readily detected all five models ( figure 2 )
staining ser473 akt observed stroma some xenografts but less intense seen tumour tissue
immunohistochemical staining various growth factor receptors showed prominent surface membrane staining egfr most cases variable expression her2 (erbb2) c-met (hgfr) igf-1r often marked intra-tumoural heterogeneity staining intensity
characteristics primary xenografts summarised table 1 
acute single dose 50?mg?kg?1 nvp-bez235 administered oral gavage well tolerated
levels ser473 phosphorylated pkb/akt measured elisa showed considerable inter-tumoural heterogeneity reflects complex nature tumours relative subcutaneous implants cell lines but there obvious decrease mean values all five models 2?h followed recovery over 24?h ( figure 3 )
we observed decrease ser9/21gsk3 ? / ? levels western blot followed similar time course p-akt ( figure 4 ) consistent inhibition pi3k/akt pathway nvp-bez235 models
we found time-dependent suppression downstream mtor targets ser235/236 s6 ribosomal protein thr37/46 4e-bp1 all five models consistent action nvp-bez235 dual pi3k mtor inhibitor
similar elisa data shown figure 3 we observed considerable inter-tumoural heterogeneity within triplicate samples some extent tracked differences total protein levels shown supplementary figure 1 
phosphorylated stat3 readily detected all five models consistent previous reports showing aberrant activation pancreatic cancer cells ( dearmond et al 2003 ) but there no significant decrease levels following treatment nvp-bez235 ( figure 4 ) suggesting mechanisms stat3 activation largely independent pi3k signalling
tumour concentrations nvp-bez235 measured all acute single-dose samples exception ocip19 where insufficient material available due their small size
drug concentrations found average higher 2?h 24?h after administration (1.01 vs 0 28.4 vs 0.50 5.5 vs 1.44 2.1 vs 1.20?nmol?g?1 ocip16 18 17 21 respectively figure 4 )
data show different maximum concentrations achieved four models but all cases compound cleared form tumour tissue time agreement reported mouse pharmacokinetic profile ( maira et al 2008 )
daily oral administration nvp-bez235 dose 45?mg?kg?1 well tolerated tumour-bearing mice
loss weight occurred control groups ocip16 17 presumably effect tumours but other groups animals maintained their weight during course treatment there no statistically significant differences body weights treated control animals end treatment any five groups ( figure 5 )
because location tumour orthotopic pancreas site tumour size not measured until end experiments when animals killed 2?h after final dose
consequently end 3- 5-week treatment orthotopic tumours dissected free surrounding normal tissues weighed
shown figure 6 nvp-bez235 treatment tumour models ocip16 17 21 resulted statistically significant delay tumour growth (56 36 46% respectively) when compared vehicle-treated controls
fourth model ocip19 showed growth inhibition but effect did not reach statistical significance whereas there no significant growth inhibition ocip18
western blot phosphorylated akt s6 readily detected tumours excised 2?h after final dose nvp-bez235 ( figure 7 ) although should noted sample processing considerably longer acute time course experiment shown figure 4 might affected results
compound concentrations tumour tissue 2?h after last treatment average 1.11 1.30 0.81 1.16?nmol?g?1 ocip16 18 17 21 respectively
hence lack efficacy observed model ocip18 cannot accounted lack exposure
nvp-bez235 did not show accumulation over time all four tumour models tested arguing efficacy likely due similar effects observed after single-dose administration
investigate mechanisms tumour growth inhibition nvp-bez235 tumours labelled cleaved caspase 3 proliferation markers cyclin d1 p27 immunohistochemistry staining intensities measured using semi-automated image analysis protocols
cleaved caspase 3 showed low levels staining relative previously observed us xenografts established cell lines there no significant increase staining any primary xenograft groups treated nvp-bez235
there trend towards reduced labelling cyclin d1 nvp-bez235-treated groups ( figure 8 ) statistically significant ocip17 19 21 whereas non-responsive ocip18 model there non-significant increase cyclin d1 nvp-bez235-treated animals
no significant effects p27 seen any five primary xenograft models
examination newly formed blood vessels using cd31 staining showed substantially present surrounding fibrovascular stroma rather invading tumour masses
we tested several image analysis routines based number cd31-stained blood vessels their size distribution within tumour tissue stroma
however none yielded significant changes patterns blood vessel formation any drug-treated tumours relative vehicle controls
importance aberrant pi3k signalling cancer been recognised many years ( hennessy et al 2005 woodgett 2005 vogt et al 2006 workman et al 2006 )
apart promoting cell growth several signalling pathways diverge downstream activated pkb/akt suppresses apoptosis
enhancement cell survival pi3k signalling probably major function during early cancer development been linked high levels drug radiation resistance seen patients pancreatic cancer ( ng et al 2001 bondar et al 2002 mackenzie 2004 brunner et al 2005 ) although should noted pancreatic cancers heterogeneous activation additional signalling elements including stat3 nf?b hedgehog pathway likely important determinant biological aggression ( bardeesy depinho 2002 arlt et al 2003 dearmond et al 2003 thayer et al 2003 )
experimental pi3k inhibitors sensitise resistant cancer cells cytotoxic agents radiation suggesting therapeutic potential clinic but until recently vivo testing limited due their toxicity poor pharmacological properties
contrast novel agent nvp-bez235 suitable drug-like properties currently been tested phase i clinical trials cancer patients
given high prevalence genetic changes drive pi3k signalling pancreatic cancers we examined pharmacodynamic anticancer effects nvp-bez235 series five recently established primary pancreatic cancer xenografts
primary xenografts established immune-deprived mice majority pancreatic cancer resections
particularly when grown orthotopic site show growth patterns including formation glandular structures embedded dense fibrovascular stroma strikingly resemble those seen surgical samples ( capella et al 1999 ng et al 2002 rubio-viqueira et al 2006 )
tumours therefore appear provide realistic laboratory setting test novel agents treating clinically intractable problem
all models tested acute single doses nvp-bez235 decreased phosphorylation pkb/akt well its immediate downstream target gsk3 maximum inhibition 2?h time point followed recovery 24?h consistent pharmacokinetics compound ( maira et al 2008 )
findings confirm nvp-bez235 able inhibit activation downstream pi3k effectors vivo 
addition its activity against class i pi3k like other pi3k inhibitors such wortmannin ly294002 ( brunn et al 1996 ) nvp-bez235 blocks catalytic activity mtor
kinase domain serine/threonine kinase high sequence similarity pi3k
we observed decreases phosphorylation downstream mtor targets particularly s6 ribosomal protein showed similar time course seen pkb/akt phosphorylation
findings suggest mtor inhibition occurs vivo drug concentrations comparable those inhibit pi3k
we tested anticancer effects nvp-bez235 using daily oral dosing similar treatment schedules commonly used clinical trials testing novel molecular targeted agents
primary end points part study animal body tumour weight end treatment period
tumour-bearing mice monitored abdominal palpation gave rough indication tumour growth
pilot study we found daily dose 45?mg?kg?1 nvp-bez235 well tolerated scid mice used xenografts although weight loss occurred more intensive treatment
finding consistent previously reported vivo efficacy studies novartis group ( stauffer et al 2007 maira et al 2008 )
using 45?mg?kg?1 daily 5 days per week dose schedule we did not see increased toxicity relative drug vehicle control group during treatment period
three five primary xenografts we observed statistically significant reduction tumour size weight relative drug vehicle control group consistent impression obtained abdominal palpation oral daily treatment nvp-bez235 inhibited tumour growth
non-significant growth inhibition seen fourth primary xenograft ocip19
produced small slow-growing tumours statistically significant effect might been lost due measurement error
fifth model ocip18 insensitive growth inhibition nvp-bez235
because acute effects pkb/akt phosphorylation comparable those seen other primary xenografts lack response nvp-bez235 treatment likely explained activity additional oncogenic signalling pathways ocip18 rather failure inhibit drug target
perhaps relevant levels cyclin d1 regulated several mechanisms downstream pi3k/mtor showed decrease all models exception ocip18 ( figure 8 )
likely use orthotopically grown early passage primary xenografts provides better prediction clinical activity relative vivo sensitivity testing based pancreatic cancer cell lines
overall effects nvp-bez235 appear less dramatic models relative those seen xenograft established cell lines ( maira et al 2008 serra et al 2008 ) typically poorly differentiated rapidly proliferating
we failed show significant anti-angiogenic effects orthotopic primary pancreatic cancer xenografts contrast other groups who reported pronounced anti-angiogenic effects mtor inhibitors used treat xenografts established pancreatic cancer cell lines ( azzariti et al 2008 manegold et al 2008 )
again we feel might reflect differences growth patterns seen using orthotopic primary xenografts
interestingly schnell et al (2008) recently shown nvp-bez235 inhibited microvessel permeability syngeneic rat mammary carcinoma model but we did not test effect present study
nevertheless response rate 3/5 seen present study appears greater recently reported other molecular targeted agents primary pancreatic cancer xenografts ( rubio-viqueira et al 2006 ) suggesting dual pi3k/mtor inhibitors like nvp-bez235 might useful anticancer effects pancreatic cancer patients
remains determined daily oral dosing schedule nvp-bez235 used study will optimal clinic
results vitro experiments suggest anticancer effects pi3k inhibitors dependant extent duration target inhibition
however acute single-dose experiments showed nvp-bez235 dose used did not completely inhibit pkb/akt tumour tissue effect relatively short duration
furthermore phosphorylated pkb/akt detectable tumour samples obtained 2?h after final dose chronic treatment group indicating incomplete drug target inhibition
unlikely complete target inhibition could sustained over long periods animal models cancer patients because pi3k signalling critical maintenance normal tissues
however possible higher doses given intermittently might give better therapeutic ratio producing more complete pi3k inhibition tumour while allowing time normal tissue recovery
alternative strategy would combine pi3k inhibitor like nvp-bez235 other anticancer agents
example we previously shown markedly enhance sensitivity standard agent gemcitabine when used intermittent dose schedule ( ng et al 2001 )
however longer term likely synergistic interactions could obtained combining pi3k inhibitors agents targeting other signalling pathways aberrantly regulated pancreatic cancers
clinical development treatment protocols incorporating multiple molecular targeted agents problematic because optimum combination would depend specific pattern abnormalities particular cancer patient
hence we believe long-term strategy needed intractable problem such pancreatic cancer requires closer integration between basic science clinical oncology including preclinical testing based models similar those used present study.
