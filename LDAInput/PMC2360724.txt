aim study characterise genetic epigenetic molecular alterations occurring primary advanced m+ m? crcs
model crc relies upon sequential accumulation genetic epigenetic changes but our study 17% cases no abnormalities investigated genes ( k-ras b-raf p53 rassf1a e-cadherin p16ink4a )
data agreement previous studies examining different sets genes
smith et al (2002) investigated k-ras p53 apc 106 cases 10% crc reported free molecular abnormalities
lee et al (2004) examined promoter methylation 12 different genes 149 crcs found 9% unmethylated
chiang et al (2004) demonstrated three key mutations (apc k-ras p53 ) rarely coincidental 122 sporadic crcs
all findings suggest alterations genes mostly involved colorectal carcinogenesis not always requested tumour progression
we found 27% k-ras mutations whole series statistical association m+ tumours (univariate analysis p =0.016 multivariate analysis p =0.019) suggesting k-ras activation important determinant extracolic tumour spread
gonzalez-aguilera et al (2004) found increased k-ras mutations tumours advanced duke's stage (a 22% b 27% c 38% d 33%) particularly when grouping m+ (46%) vs m? tumours (26%)
aberrant activation k-ras been implicated facilitating all aspects malignant phenotype including proliferation invasion metastases ras effectors such pik3 raf/mek/erk cascade rho gtpases
recently some authors proposed epithelial cells activated ras signalling require cooperation other signalling pathway became metastogenic ( grunert et al 2003 ) oncogenic ras thought cooperates several other proto-oncogenes such p53 p16ink4a ( serrano et al 1996 aguirre et al 2003 )
cooperation between ras other genes likely occur crc progression because our study only 6% tumours showed exclusive presence k-ras mutation
e-cadherin promoter methylation prevalent right colon (univariate analysis p =0.011 multivariate analysis p =0.007) so coincidental k-ras mutations e-cadherin methylation frequently occurred proximal (27%) rather left colon (5%) rectum (8%) ( p <0.001)
whether e-cadherin methylation k-ras mutation cooperate right side colonic carcinogenesis progression confirmed larger series
b-raf rarely found mutated our cases never conjunction k-ras 
previously noted ( rajagopalan et al 2002 yuen et al 2002 ) k-ras b-raf mutations appear mutually exclusive confirming previous suggestions similar biological targets ras-raf-mek-erk-map kinase signalling pathway ( yuen et al 2002 )
small proportion cases (10/202=5%) showed both k-ras mutations rassf1a methylation interestingly all cases m+ ( p =0.016)
whether alterations both genes may able confer more aggressive phenotype remains established larger series
our study p53 abnormalities not prevalent m+ tumours suggesting limited role p53 crc metastatisation
different results reported goh et al (1999) used only sscp detect p53 mutations
among tumour suppressor genes showing dna methylation p16ink4a seems play major role metastogenic phenotype primary crcs
methylation seen 33% whole series like k-ras mutation significantly associated m+ phenotype (univariate analysis p =0.011 multivariate analysis p =0.001)
strong correlation between staging p16ink4a methylation found yi et al (2001) loss p16ink4a expression been previously associated lymph-node metastases ( kim et al 2005a ) more advanced stage ( jeong et al 2005 )
altogether results suggest p16ink4a methylation might link more malignant phenotype crc interestingly liang et al (1999) recently reported association between p16ink4a methylation shorter survival crc
coincidental alterations k-ras p16ink4a mainly found m+ tumours (2/67 m? tumours vs 17/139 m+ tumours p =0.034) suggesting abnormalities pathways could cooperate more aggressive phenotype previously supported serrano et al (1997 )
another focus study examine interactions between genetic epigenetic alterations induction metastogenic phenotype
regardless type molecular abnormalities tumours three more but not those less three significantly more prevalent group m+ tumours ( p =0.023)
means genes under study confer more aggressive phenotype when molecular changes deregulate least three them
hypothesis keeping stepwise model progression crc
given fraction m? crcs (13%) already harbours three more molecular changes we currently analysing cohort ascertain whether cases will develop metachronous liver metastasis increase rate compared m? crcs <3 molecular changes
group m+ tumours showing three more abnormal genes characterised single genetic mutation (usually k-ras 53%) two epigenetic alterations (equally affecting p16ink4a rassf1a e-cadherin )
notably toyota et al (2000) found k-ras mutations significantly prevalent crcs so called methylator phenotype (cimp) compared cimp negative cases
stepwise increase number methylated genes observed lesion progression through stages multistep colorectal carcinogenesis lee et al (2004) 
our study showed coincidental methylation three genes ( rassf1a e-cadherin p16ink4a ) restricted m+ tumours ( p =0.042)
unclear why advanced m+ crcs showed high degree methylation: perhaps advanced tumours inherited major biological aggressiveness simply more likely become methylated
notably patients showing three methylated genes older age (73.83 vs 65.60 years p =0.017) keeping suggestion put forwards toyota issa (1999 ) age-related methylation might contribute sharp increase cancer risk after age 60 years
interestingly present study younger age statistically associated m+ tumours
likely due internal selection surgical treatment being older age limiting factor radical surgical resection ( leporrier et al 2006 )
conclusion analysis panel genes provided detect some genetic epigenetic molecular differences between m+ m? primary crcs
set genetic epigenetic molecular abnormalities feature primary m+ crcs likely conferring ability tumour extracolic spread determining markers aggressive behaviour potential therapeutic targets.
