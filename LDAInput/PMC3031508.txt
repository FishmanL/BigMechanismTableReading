bioenergetic status non-small cell lung cancer correlates tumour aggressiveness
voltage dependent anion channel type 1 (vdac1) component mitochondrial permeability transition pore regulates mitochondrial atp/adp exchange suggesting its over-expression could associated energy dependent processes including increased proliferation invasiveness
test hypothesis we conducted vivo gene-expression meta-analysis surgically resected non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) using 602 individual expression profiles examine impact vdac1 survival
high vdac1 expression associated shorter overall survival hazard ratio (hr)?=?0.6639 (95% confidence interval (ci) 0.4528 0.9721) p?=?0.035352 corresponding 52 versus 101 months
vdac1 predicted shorter time recurrence shown independent prognostic factor compared histology gender age nodal stage tumour stage cox multivariate analysis
supervised analysis all datasets identified 6-gene signature comprising hnrnpc hspa4 hspa9 ube2d2 csnk1a1 g3bp1 overlapping functions involving regulation protein turnover ras-raf-mek pathway transcription
vdac1 predicted survival breast cancer myeloma unsupervised analysis revealed enrichment vdac1 signature specific subsets
summary gene expression analysis identifies vdac1 gene expression predictor poor outcome nsclc other cancers associated dysregulation conserved set biological pathways may causally associated aggressive tumour behaviour
non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) common largely incurable cancer
early disease setting surgical resection standard care benefit adjuvant chemotherapy limited 5?15% improvement survival stage ii but not stage i disease [1] 
however relapse frequent stage i cancer 37% patients dying within five years therefore there need identify reliable biomarkers poor outcome order target individuals whom adjuvant novel targeted therapy may improve survival
alteration tumour metabolism hallmark cancer high levels hexokinase-dependent glucose trapping nsclc evidenced standardized uptake values positron emission tomography associated shorter survival [2] 
seen both early advanced nsclc [3] [4] 
voltage dependent anion channel 1 (vdac1) outer mitochondrial membrane protein involved regulation atp/adp exchange respiratory control [5] 
vdac1 interacts proapoptotic bcl-2 family proteins [6] [7] 
however its role regulating mitochondrial outer membrane depolarization been controversial [8] [9] [10] 
yet emerging data identified potential role protein regulation cell survival reason we found worthy further study
permeability transition pore comprises vdac1 directly regulated bh3-only proapoptotic bcl-2 family member bad [10] regulates cell survival
contrast type ii isoform (vdac2) been identified antiapoptotic negative regulator bak [9] [11] [12] 
adenine-nucleotide translocator (ant) located inner mitochondrial considered major component permeability transition pore [13] along vdac believed control mitochondrial remodeling processes either directly indirectly [14] 
recently bacterial protein fila [15] been shown regulate complex vdac1 hexokinase ii [16] inhibits apoptosis
growing body data suggests hexokinase-vdac interaction anti-apoptotic [17] disruption interaction could strategy inducing cell death [18] [19] 
vdac-hexokinase complex been reported regulated glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta [19] akt [20] 
cancer cells low vdac1 induced rna interference exhibit defect cell growth vivo [21] 
conversely high levels vdac1 expression levels may confer tumour cell selection advantage facilitating energy dependent processes such proliferation invasiveness [22] 
although hexokinase ii expression been linked worse prognosis [23] date there been no studies exploring potential prognostic impact vdac1 patients cancer
therefore hypothesized vdac1 expression could impact survival following nsclc resection
here we show using gene expression meta-analysis vdac1 overexpression strong independent poor prognostic factor early stage non-small cell lung cancer based combined analysis multiple gene expression datasets
vdac1 overexpression consistently associated overexpression 6 additional genes involved survival signalling protein ubiquitination atp binding
association maintained across multiple independent datasets across different cancers suggesting potential role biological processes regulating tumour behaviour therefore clinical outcome nsclc
total 8 independent nsclc datasets curated gene expression omnibus (geo) total 602 microarrays
all datasets high expression vdac1 (upper tertile) associated significantly shorter survival compared lower tertile vdac1 expression p?=?0.0353 hr?=?0.6639 (0.4528 0.9721) ( figure 1a )
average overall survival 101.6 months patients lowest vdac1 tertile 52 months patients highest vdac1 tertile
figure 1a: displays kaplan meier plot depicting patient survival dependent high low vdac1 expression
distinct difference survival visibly evident median survival high vdac1 expressing patients being only half low expressing patients
curves significantly different p?=?0.0353 logrank test
figure 1b: survival plot stage i patients
again difference high low expressing samples clear low vdac1 patients having better survival rates
logrank test proves curves significantly different p?=?0.0455
stage i samples follow same pattern all combined data all stages
further explore impact vdac1 survival we carried out correlation cox regression analysis well multivariate tests using pasw statistics v.18 (spss: ibm company)
high vdac1 expression shown independent prognostic variable shorter survival p<0.001 level
stage (p?=?0.013) pt (primary tumour) (p?=?0.022) proved independent variables correlated survival while multivariate analysis showed combination stage histology significantly influences patient survival (p?=?0.027)
results cox regression analysis seen table 1 where vdac1 most significant influence survival followed pt stage
influence vdac1 stage survival evident figure high vdac1 expression inducing poor survival
vdac1 most significant predictor survival time stage pt displaying predictive power
age patient their gender whether tumour squamous adenocarcinoma didn't large effect overall survival time
influence vdac1 expression time relapse following surgical resection interest clinical variable not confounded therapy after relapse
therefore more accurate measure prognostic significance
so we analysed only recurrence data univariate analysis showed vdac1 significantly predict time recurrence (p<0.001)
information histological subtype gender age available all samples found not significant p values 0.35 0.82 0.73 respectively
summary analysis found table 2 
similarly multivariate analysis ranked variables same order vdac1 being only independent factor (p<0.001)
when dealing time recurrence vdac1 expression again shown most significant variable predicting time recurrence
we found no significant relationship between recurrence tumour type gender age
information stage not available all datasets but we analysed what we access to
we 89 stage i samples kaplan-meier plot patients shown figure 1b p?=?0.0455 associated hazard ratio 0.52 (0.1492?0.7653)
we found correlation between vdac1 expression survival very strong p<0.001
cox regression analysis stage 1 nsclc where adjuvant chemotherapy not been shown improve patient outcome [24] [25] [26] revealed no variables statistically significant but similarly analysis all data vdac1 most influential predictor survival (p?=?0.241) ranked above histology (p?=?0.344) age (p?=?0.465) pt (p?=?0.970) pn (nodal stage) (p?=?0.975) gender (p?=?0.999)
regression coefficient vdac1 29.18 indicating very poor prognosis patients high levels vdac1.the sample numbers low stages ii iii 68 samples being stage ii only 16 samples being stage iii made difficult obtain statistically significant results
correlation between vdac1 expression survival stage ii samples stage iii samples insignificant p?=?0.853 p?=?0.701 respectively
we inadequate number events both stages produce accurate kaplan meier plot less 10 incidences death per category
lack higher stage samples led us focus output stage i samples combined data
order gain insight biology underlying poor prognosis vdac1 overexpressing nsclc vivo analysis conducted identify genes gene networks consistently associated high vdac1 expression
subset 6 genes identified vdac1 overexpressing nsclc datasets associated significant differential expression 50% more datasets

csnk1a1 hspa4 hspa9 linked atp binding while hnrnpc involved rna nucleotide binding
summary go terms genes found table 3 
hnrnpc hspa9 g3bp1 ube2d2 determined being prognostic individually when univariate analysis carried out their expression levels survival time associated p values 0.027 0.002 0.02 0.003 respectively
chart shows variation gene expression our differentially expressed genes samples where vdac1 expression low when high
all genes collectively made up our signature upregulated so increase when vdac1 increases
any genes involved same processes easily identifiable overlap evident
ubiquitination most common known process shared significant genes however ras signalling p53 regulation linked 2 genes signature
we analysed data without filtering vdac1 expression reaffirm vdac1 would significantly differentially expressed when expression levels living dead patients compared
using unsupervised method ranking gene expression according overall survival time vdac1 found downregulated patients longer survival
similarly 6 genes regulated alongside vdac1 behaved same way them downregulated samples patients survived long period time
confirm validity potential biological relevance 6-gene signature covariant vdac1 we tested its discriminative power independent breast cancer dataset
t-test performed comparing high low vdac1 expressing samples
we found all 6 genes upregulated when vdac1 highly expressed
similarly expression low when vdac1 expression low so our signature genes covariant vdac1 nsclc data exhibited same expression patterns breast cancer data
we carried out same test using independent myeloma cancer dataset performing t-test data split based vdac1 high low expression
we again found all 6 genes our meta-signature returned being statistically significant p<0.001 level
additional validation found through analysis nci60 cell lines found gse2003
we again compared samples based vdac1 expression found 6-gene signature conserved 8 cell lines namely uacc62 sk_mel2 (melanoma) sf295 sf539 (cns) a498 snc12c (renal) h23 hop62 (nsclc)

independent prognostic factor evidenced cox regression analysis predicts survival stage 1 disease where subgroup analysis randomized controlled clinical trials adjuvant chemotherapy failed show clinical benefit [24] [25] [26] 
combined gene expression data analysis approach been employed investigate impact vdac1 expression survival statistically significant all individual datasets examined
several recent studies analysing microarray data prognostic markers nsclc produced inconsistent results [29] 
distinct lack overlap associated between signatures reflects instability attributed small sample sizes less 200 samples used per study
analysis multiple datasets example combined analysis microarray gene expression datasets addressing similar biological questions conducted interpretational level meta-analysis enable more accurate results
many studies propose methods meta-analysis microarray data aim identifying significantly differentially expressed genes across studies using statistical techniques avoid direct comparison gene expression values [30] 
evaluation multiple datasets employed study been shown yield more reliable valid results because based large sample numbers individual bias caused study weakened [30] 
not known why vdac1 correlates poor survival outcomes
understand most relevant genetic features vdac1 overexpressing nsclc we conducted gene expression meta-analysis [31] [32] identify subset genes (signature) significantly enriched

we tested meta-signature myeloma dataset (gse2658) hg-u133 plus2.0 array data 559 patients who received chemotherapy
further validation found through analysis nci60 cell line panel (gse2003) we checked gene expression matched what we found our subset significant genes
additionally we checked our results carrying out principal components analysis data gse3141
distribution vdac1 expression subdivided tertiles data set corresponding low medium high
kaplan-meier curves plotted using prism (graphpad software san diego california usa www.graphpad.com ) based survival data comparing highest versus lowest tertile vdac1 initially plots produced all data then only stage i
hazard ratios comparing low high vdac1 expressing samples calculated
we carried out correlation analysis between vdac1 expression survival time using spearman's rank correlation coefficient
we performed univariate multivariate analysis using pasw (spss: ibm company) recurrence-free overall survival used clinical endpoints assess prognostic significance vdac1 logrank ratio considered significant p<0.05
cox multivariate analysis used determine whether vdac1 independent prognostic variable relation 7 clinical variables: age gender stage histology tumour size (pt) nodal stage (pn) survival
we adopted method termed meta-analysis microarrays determine what genes regulated alongside vdac1 [45] 
dataset subdivided according vdac1 expression tertiles we compared top bottom vdac1 tertiles samples using tmev [46] 
gene assessed differential expression using two class t-test dataset class 1 being low vdac1 expression class 2 high vdac1 expression
bonferroni's correction used analysis carried out all 8 datasets
bonferroni's correction helps minimise likelihood generating false positives
number probes vast some datasets containing more 54000 so reduce our significant genes manageable list per dataset we used stringent cut off criteria where gene labelled significantly differentially expressed t-test returned p value less 0.001
same hypotheses tested nsclc dataset independently e.g
genes differentially expressed based vdac1 expression
enable multiple hypothesis testing we used method compares statistical measures q values (estimated false discovery rates) calculated independently dataset [32] [47] where where p probability n total number genes i sorted rank p value
strict p value cut-off we applied carried forward when q values calculated
after ranking significantly differentially expressed genes based their q value direction significance threshold q<0.10 set define differential expression signatures already computed differential expression analysis
having obtained ordered list differentially expressed genes dataset genes then filtered based number datasets differentially expressed.
genes defined being significantly differentially expressed then validated independent breast cancer datasets (gse6434 gse2034) obtained geo 24 286 samples respectively
we tested meta-signature myeloma dataset (gse2658) 559 samples
t-tests performed additional data we compared high low vdac1 expressing samples determine genes our signature identified once again
same procedure used nci60 cell lines identify cell lines expression levels matched our signature
using vdac1 six associated sde genes seeds together their interactions found human protein reference database (hprd) [48] parent ppi network (including recursive interactions) created using in-house java-based program
using seed proteins initial depth (level 0) subsequent depths obtained using snowball sampling
resulting parent ppi network (9266 gene nodes 38800) then viewed manipulated analyzed cytoscape [49] 
using network analyzer plug-in [50] gene nodes then identified either hubs bottlenecks using classification yu et al [28] top 20% nodes degree value identified hubs remainder non-hubs
same ranking method applied betweenness centrality metric identify bottleneck nodes
node ppi network thus classified one four categories: non-hub-non-bottlenecks (nh/nb) hub-non-bottlenecks (h/nb) non-hub-bottlenecks (nh/b) hub-bottlenecks (h/b)
