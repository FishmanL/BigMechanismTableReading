lung cancer one most deadly cancers worldwide [1] ? [3] more 160000 deaths per year
number one cancer killer united states ( seer www.seer.cancer.gov [2] )
seventy-five eighty-five percent lung cancers categorized non-small cell cancers (nsclc) adenocarcinoma become most prevalent nsclc subtype [1] [3] 
been reported 50?60% non-small cell lung cancers 90% small cell lung tumors contain p53 mutations thus p53 alterations among most common genetic events malignancy [4] [5] 
majority p53 mutations missense found within sequence-specific dna-binding domain
codon 273 one most frequently mutated sites [6] ? [8] 
human mutant p53(273h) most common substitution (arginine histidine) been shown both dominant-negative gain-of-function properties [9] ? [13] 
unlike most tumor-derived mutant p53 proteins p53(273h) retains partial sequence-specific dna-binding transcriptional activation functions [14] ? [17] 
addition p53(273h) been reported interact activate topoisomerase i induce genomic instability [13] [18] promote reassociation single-stranded rna dna double-stranded form [19] 
thus p53(273h) could conceivably lead increased cell proliferation aberrant dna recombination increased genomic instability reduced chemotherapy efficacy [20] [21] 
p53270h/+ mice (murine p53 codon 270 correspond human p53 codon 273) develop increased incidence carcinomas b cell lymphomas compared p53+/? mice [22]

evaluate whether murine wild type p53 intact lung cancers collected spc-p53 (273h) transgenic mice we treated transgenic mice using 137cesium ?-source dose 5gy/mouse
maximize evaluation vivo brdu labeling performed
mice injected brdu dose 100 mg/kg 22 hr post-irradiation
non-irradiated controls injected brdu
both irradiated control mice sacrificed lung tissues harvested 2 hours after brdu injection
we analyzed 60 pathological images collected six lung tumor bearing mice three been irradiated
rate brdu positive cells 2.61% non-irradiated tumors average whereas proliferating rate 0.93% irradiated lung tumor samples
thus compared non-irradiated tumors tumor cell proliferation rate reduced 2.8 fold after ?-irradiation treatment ( fig

above results suggest lung tumors p53(273h) transgenic mice composed mixed population cells
some lung tumor cells retain murine wild type p53 while others lost functional murine p53 continue proliferate even after irradiation

given high prevalence k-ras p16 gene deficiencies human lung cancers [33] ? [36] we evaluated k-ras gene mutations p16 promoter methylation spontaneous lung cancers both transgenic non-transgenic animals
we analyzed 28 murine lung tumors 21 transgenic mice 7 tumors non-transgenic mice
six transgenic mice 4?12 months fifteen 13?24 months
all non-transgenic tumors collected age 13?24 months given their rare occurrence earlier age
been reported k-ras mutations occur mainly codons 12 13 61 murine lung tumors [37] thus we investigated dna sequences exons 2 3 contain codons 12 13 61 using pcr amplification followed dna sequencing
among 21 transgenic tumors ten tumor samples (47.6%) contained k-ras mutations
included four exon 2 (codons 12 13) six exon 3 (codon 61)
among 7 non-transgenic tumors two mutations found exon 2 (codon 12) two codon 61 ( table 1 )

most important function wild type p53 sequence specific transactivation target genes
normal cells steady state level p53 protein low half-life p53 very short due presence negative regulators such mdm2 jnk pirh2 [38] ? [44] 
however dna damage (e.g radiation) induces prominent increase p53 protein levels [45] [46] 
increase wild type p53 protein response dna damage believed regulate p21 prevent cells genetic lesions proliferate [47] 
either cell cycle arrest apoptotic cell death remove damaged cell permanently follows [48] 
mutations p53 vast majority within sequence-specific dna-binding domain protein produce mutant proteins unable bind transactivate target genes mediate tumor suppression [48] ? [50] 
restoration p53 function leads tumor regression vivo [51] 
general assumption tumor cells intact p53 will stop proliferating after irradiation whereas tumor cells deficient p53 will proliferate continually post irradiation
our results demonstrated some tumor cells transgenic animals failed initiate cell cycle arrest post irradiation so 0.93% lung tumor cells brdu positive
comparison there no brdu positive cells observed normal lung tissues collected same mouse post irradiation
given even one copy intact p53 could cause complete cell cycle arrest mice lungs post irradiation follows brdu positive cells observed lung tumors lost p53 function completely
several potential mechanisms p53 mutant induced tumorigenesis been proposed
one possibility mutant p53 inhibits sequence-specific dna-binding transactivation functions wild-type p53 ?dominant-negative? manner forming hetero-oligomeric complexes [10] [11] 
alternatively certain p53 mutants may possess intrinsic oncogenic potential their introduction cells lacking endogenous p53 been shown enhance tumorigenicity cells [12] [50] 
since human murine p53 proteins fully capable forming hetero-oligomeric complexes [52] therefore possible human p53(273h) affected murine wild type p53 function transgenic mice studied through ?dominant-negative? effect leading increased cell proliferation [53] [54] 
interestingly tumor rate differences observed between transgenics non-transgenic counterparts beginning 13 months equalizes after 22 months suggesting genome instability associated senescence [55] [56] diluting any difference transgene effect could produce
previously we reported level mouse wild-type p53 protein reduced 10 10 tumor samples compared matched normal lung tissue transgenic mouse [57] 
reduction level murine wildtype p53 protein may associated overexpression p53 ubiquitin?protein ligase pirh2 ?dominant-negative? effect mutant p53
one copy wild type p53 sufficient cause cell cycle arrest post irradiation [54] may explain delay tumor development our transgenic animals two murine wildtype p53 alleles addition human mutant
would suggests p53(273h) weak dominant-negative effect
previous vitro studies support notion [14] [17] 
age 13?21 months when additional genetic epigenetic alterations able combine mutant p53 significant difference tumor formation between transgenic non-transgenic mice would then appreciated
we analyzed 28 spontaneous lung tumors found 27% lung tumors k-ras mutations (all somatic) codons 12?13 age 13?24 months whereas no mutation detected codons earlier age
thus onset k-ras mutations codons 12 13 murine lung tumor appear age related phenomenon appearing similar rate tumor-developing transgenic non-transgenic littermates
murine lung tumors been shown contain high frequency k-ras mutation codon 61 [37] 
type kras mutation extremely rare human tumors especially lung cancer
among 28 lung tumors eight tumors (29%) contained k-ras mutation codon 61 its frequency similar between transgenics (27%) non-transgenics (29%) between 4?12 months transgenic cohort (33%) 13?24 months transgenic cohort (27%) suggesting its lack association age collaboration p53 mutations (4?15 months vs
16?24 months: fisher's exact p?=?0.936)
p16 gene promoter hypermethylation common event lung cancers [36] up 80% lung adenocarcinomas [58] 
our study demonstrated aberrant methylation p16 gene more frequently 13?24 months cohort 4?12 months cohort (82% vs
17% respectively)
results would suggest inactivation p16 methylation its promoter region similar k-ras codons 12?13 mutations late age dependent event contributing lung tumor formation p53(273h) transgenic mice
summary expression mutant p53 (273h) mice lungs resulted age-related demographic shift lung tumor formation transgenic mice
latency period tumors develop transgenic mice would suggest mutant p53(273h) combine other age-related genetic epigenetic alterations such mutation codon 12 13 k-ras gene inactivation p16 methylation its promoter region promote lung tumor formation progression p53(273h) transgenics
our model may recapitulate what occurs human cancer where age specific differences been reported [59] [60] where tumor formation substantially lags behind oncogenic stimulus [61] [62] 
while p53 k-ras codons 12/13 mutations p16 promoter methylation status well described human lung cancers influence age likelihood abnormalities combine early genetic events not been previously explored
our study supports multi-step genetic hits process documented other malignancies familial cancer clusters available suggests need evaluate age related differences pattern genetic epigenetic aberrations linked lung cancer patient disease
