insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (igf1r) targeted therapies resulted responses small number patients advanced metastatic ewing's sarcoma
we performed morphoproteomic profiling better understand response/resistance mechanisms ewing's sarcoma igf1r inhibitor-based therapy
pilot study assessed two patients advanced ewing's sarcoma treated igf1r antibody alone followed combined igf1r inhibitor plus mammalian target rapamycin (mtor) inhibitor treatment once resistance single-agent igf1r inhibitor developed
immunohistochemical probes applied detect p-mtor (ser2448) p-akt (ser473) p-erk1/2 (thr202/tyr204) nestin p-stat3 (tyr 705) original recurrent tumor
initial remarkable radiographic responses igf1r-antibody therapy followed resistance then response combined igf1r plus mtor inhibitor therapy both patients then resistance combination regimen one patient
patient 1 upregulation p-akt p-mtor tumor relapsed after initial response igf1r antibody might explain resistance developed subsequent response combined igf1r plus mtor inhibitor therapy
patient 2 upregulation mtor seen primary tumor perhaps explaining initial response igf1r mtor inhibitor combination while resistant tumor emerged showed activation erk pathway well
morphoproteomic analysis revealed mtor pathway activated two patients advanced ewing's sarcoma who showed response combined igf1r mtor inhibition erk pathway patient whom resistance combination emerged
our pilot results suggests morphoproteomic assessment signaling pathway activation ewing's sarcoma merits further investigation guide understanding response resistance signatures
ewing's sarcoma second most common malignant bone tumor children adolescents young adults
despite using multimodal approach combining surgery chemotherapy radiation therapeutic plateau been attained no change overall survival [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] 
attempts improve clinical outcome through collaborative trials beginning early 1970s sought optimize care through ever more mechanistically-diverse chemotherapies
strategies included increasing duration treatment dosage per cycle decreasing treatment interval (i.e interval dose compression) using high-dose myeloablative chemotherapy followed peripheral blood stem cell transplant [3] 
however survival remains poor patients metastatic disease
metastatic ewing's sarcoma diagnosis risk refractory recurrent disease approaches 80% after initial therapy outcome recurrent disease poor event-free survival less 20% [3] 
treatment options patients refractory recurrent ewing's sarcoma limited
early phase clinical trials frequently combine targeted agents optimize benefit
two challenges outset 1) deciding agents combine given heterogeneity tumors their various underlying resistance pathways feedback loops 2) how translate findings bench bedside directly bedside [6] 
morphoproteomics (morphology+proteomics) involves immunohistochemical assessment activation signaling pathways cancer cells predicting susceptibility small-molecule inhibitors specific chemotherapeutic agents possibly differentiating agents [7] 
some cases drugs fail early disease trajectory produce renewed tumor regression later particularly rational addition another drug [8] 
morphoproteomics potentially identify targeted combinations drugs appropriate prospective testing [9] 
insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (igf1r)-targeted therapies shown early promise [10] responses small number patients ewing's sarcoma [4] [11] [12] [13] 
currently available igf1r antibodies recognize different epitopes receptor therefore may exert different biological/clinical responses [14] [15] 
even so phase i studies different igf1r antibodies demonstrated remarkable responses subset ewing's sarcoma patients [11] [12] [13] 
while response rates phase ii studies not yet been reported clear while some responses been dramatic occurred only minority patients
mechanisms underlying primary secondary response resistance unknown

there no effective therapy advanced ewing's sarcoma patients advanced metastatic disease succumb their disease
two patients ewing's sarcoma who responded but then progressed after igf1r inhibitor therapy alone showed consistently high mtorc2 expression their tumors
both patients responded after treatment combined igf1r mtor inhibition
time interval between first second igf1r based therapy 1 month patient 1 4 months patient 2
one patient continued response remained igf1r-based therapy more 50 months last 14 months been igf1r inhibitor combined mtor inhibitor
patient's last imaging scans showed no disease
unfortunately second patient acquired resistance
preclinical studies shown mtor bypass pathway igf1r targeting
similarly combined inhibition igf1r mtor may circumvent counterproductive rapamycin-induced upregulation akt occur within 6 hours treatment [3] [22] 
several phase i/ii clinical trials currently investigating potential synergy advanced malignancies

context our finding upregulated p-akt (ser473) p-mtor (ser2448) patient 1's resistant tumor emerged following igf1r antibody therapy consistent resistance mechanism could related upregulation torc2
patient however treated successfully termsirolimus torc1 inhibitor
although short-term inhibition torc1 drives torc2 formation results akt activation long-term torc1 inhibition abrogates akt expression through activation s6k pkd1 blocks torc2 assembly [23] [24] 
activated s6k down-modulate akt acting against insulin receptor substrate 1 proteins p13k [23] 
although pathways often been depicted linear clearly there complex interplay among signaling elements ( figure 7 )
ews-fli1 fusion protein hallmark ewing's sarcoma downregulates insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 igfbp3 upregulates igf-1 expression resulting enhanced igf1r [25] 
therefore treatment igf1r inhibitor may counteract ews-fli1-mediated upregulation insulin receptor (ir) /igf1r machinery
temsirolimus ?rapalog? rapamycin been shown downregulate ews-fli1 fusion protein [26] possibly lessening ir/igf1r signaling therefore providing additional pathway molecule might operative patient

igf1r antibody inhibits igf1r signaling rapalogs (temsirolimus case) inhibit mtorc1 short term eventually inhibit mtorc 2 chronic exposure suppresses ews-fli1 drives tumorigenesis ewing's sarcoma
ews-fli1 suppresses nestin
patient 2 constitutive activation akt mtor similar patient 1's recurrent tumor seen baseline pre-treatment tumor tumor resistant igf1r mtor combination treatment
observations suggest possibility torc2 pathway role primary recurrent tumor [17] ( figures 5 6 7 )
after igfr treatment alone response followed resistance
similarly initial response followed re-emergence resistance following treatment igfr-mtor inhibitor combination
mechanism response igfr mtor combination may similar patient 1 through akt mtor suppression occurs chronic temsirolimus exposure [23] [24] 
biologic activity mtor inhibitor temsirolimus further confirmed upregulation nestin seen patient's igfr/mtor resistant tumor since temsirolimus down-modulates ews-fli1 would expected upregulate nestin [26] [27] ( figure 7 )
however other pathways operative patient's tumor including ras/raf /erk stat3 ( figure 5 ).the relative overexpression cd99 patient consistent activation pathway (not shown)
addition p-akt s6k not downregulated combined igf1r mtor inhibition perhaps due ras/raf/erk activation
signals might account tumor resistance [26] 
interest addition nestin patient's recurrent tumor showed propensity toward differentiation along neural lines demonstrated increased expression other neural markers such cd56 neural cell adhesion molecule synaptophysin
we demonstrated resistance/response mechanisms morphoproteomics two patients advanced ewing's sarcoma
needs analyzed retrospectively validated prospectively larger dataset allow more robust conclusions
next generaration whole exome sequencing patients ewing's sarcoma responding igf1r based treatment reverse phase protein array analysis patients acquiring resistance underway will help decipher unidentified mechanisms perhaps unravel novel mutations genetic aberrations response resistance pathways
our observations suggest rational combinations targeted therapy modulate multiple relevant pathways may useful overcoming resistance patients ewing's sarcoma
inhibition igf1r and/or igf1r mtor resulted significant clinical activity patients ewing's sarcoma
study igf1r inhibitor combined mtor inhibitor currently underway
our pilot results suggests morphoproteomic assessment signaling pathway activation ewing's sarcoma merits further investigation guide understanding response resistance signatures.
