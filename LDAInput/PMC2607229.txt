study examined status kras braf mutations relation extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (erk) activation 58 ovarian carcinomas clarify clinicopathological prognostic significance kras/braf mutations
somatic mutations either kras braf identified 12 (20.6%) out 58 ovarian carcinomas
frequency kras/braf mutations conventional serous high-grade carcinomas (4.0%?:?1/25) significantly lower other histological type (32.3%?:?10/31)
phosphorylated erk1/2 (p-erk1/2) expression identified 18 (38.2%) out 45 ovarian carcinomas
kras/braf mutation significantly correlated international federation gynecology obstetrics (figo) stage i ii ( p <0.001) p-erk1/2 ( p <0.001)
no significant correlations between kras/braf mutations p-erk1/2 expression overall survival found patients ovarian carcinoma treated platinum taxane chemotherapy ( p =0.2460 p =0.9339 respectively)
next clarify roles erk1/2 activation ovarian cancers harbouring kras braf mutations we inactivated erk1/2 ovarian cancer cells using ci-1040
cl-1040 compound selectively inhibits map kinase kinase (mek) upstream regulator erk1/2 thus prevents erk1/2 activation
profound growth inhibition apoptosis observed ci-1040-treated cancer cells mutations either kras braf comparison ovarian cancer cells containing wild-type sequences
evident both vitro vivo studies
findings study indicate activated erk1/2 pathway critical tumour growth survival ovarian cancers kras braf mutations
furthermore suggest ci-1040-induced phenotypes depend mutational status kras braf ovarian cancers

mutational status kras braf all 45 ovarian carcinomas summarised table 1 
somatic mutations kras identified 8 (13.7%) out 58 ovarian carcinomas
contrast somatic mutations braf identified 5 (8.6%) out 58 ovarian carcinomas
somatic mutations either kras braf identified 12 (20.6%) out 58 ovarian carcinomas
most kras mutations located codon 12 all braf mutations codon 600
both codons mutation hot spots
interestingly simultaneous mutations kras braf did not occur tested ovarian carcinomas exception one mucinous case
panel ovarian cancer cell lines primary cultures first analysed tumour mutation status kras braf genes
shown figure 1 three ovarian cancer cell lines harboured either kras braf mutations
frequency either kras braf mutations conventional serous high-grade carcinomas (4.0%?:?1/25) significantly lower other histological type (32.2%?:?10/31)
immunoreactivity active p-erk1/2 detected both nucleus cytoplasm tumour cells ( figure 2 )
consistent earlier report ( mizumoto et al 2007 )
positive active p-erk1/2 identified 27 (46.6%) out 58 ovarian carcinomas
patients stratified two groups depending mutational status kras/braf 
relationships between kras/braf mutations clinicopathological factors including p-erk1/2 expression shown table 2 
there no significant correlation between kras/braf mutations patient's age
results table 2 show kras/braf mutation correlated significantly figo stage i ii ( p <0.001) p-erk1/2 ( p <0.001)
addition there significant correlations between kras/bra f mutations pathological grade ( p =0.004) histological subtype ( p =0.014)
next we examined prognostic effect kras/braf mutations p-erk1/2 expression
out 58 samples we examined 45 available prognostic analysis
kaplan?meier estimates overall survival plotted figure 3 
there no significant relationship between kras/braf mutations p-erk1/2 expression overall survival patients ovarian carcinoma ( p =0.2460 p =0.9339 respectively)
univariate analysis showed only figo stage iii iv affected overall survival patients ovarian carcinoma significantly( p =0.014)
panel ovarian cancer cell lines primary cultures ovarian cancer first analysed kras braf gene mutation status
mutational status correlated growth inhibition apoptosis induction mek inhibitor ci-1040 prevented activation downstream target erk1/2
western blot analysis showed dose-dependent effect expression active erk1/2 es2 cells active erk1/2 not detectable 6?h after treating cells ci-1040 concentration 5? ? m ( figure 4 )
shown figure 5 four tumours harbouring either kras braf mutations showed marked reduction (<50% dmso control) cell number ci-1040-treated group compared other 14 tumours containing wild-type kras braf ( p <0.001)
ci-1040 no significant effect growth normal cells including ose cells
likely kras/braf mutation not only determinant activating erk1/2
therefore we analysed p-erk1/2 expression cell lines listed figure 5 
only four cell lines mdah2774 es2 mpsc1 poc1 strongly expressed p-erk1/2
skov3 a2780 showed weak expression erk1/2.these results suggest activation erk1/2 may depend kras/braf mutation ovarian cancer cells
assess mechanisms underlying growth inhibition ci-1040 we measured percentages brdurd-labelled cells annexin v-labelled cells estimate proliferation apoptosis respectively
we found ci-1040 significantly reduced cellular proliferation induced apoptosis cell lines either kras braf mutations comparison cell lines wild-type sequences ( figure 6 supplementary figure 1 )
basis above findings we investigated whether ci-1040 growth-inhibitory effect tumour formation development vivo 
tumour xenografts both mdah2774 ( kras mutant) skov3 (wild type kras braf ) cell lines established nu / nu mouse model
all mice injected ci-1040 developed significantly smaller intra-abdominal xenograft tumours mice carrying diluent control cells kras mutant cell line madh2774 ( figure 7a )
there no differences intra-abdominal xenograft tumour weights between ci-1040-treated group control groups transplanted wild-type kras/bra f cell line skov3 ( figure 7b )
histological examination tumours after ci-1040 treatment showed inactivation p-erk1/2 tumour cells based immunohistochemistry ( figure 7c d )
significantly higher frequency kras/braf mutations non-serous type carcinomas compared conventional high-grade serous carcinomas study finding great interest
suggests conventional high-grade serous non-serous tumours may distinguished basis characteristic genetic alterations
addition observation further supports theory ovarian carcinoma arises multiple pathways ( shih ie kurman 2004 2005 )
model conventional high-grade serous non-serous carcinomas develop independently one another characterised different molecular genetic changes gene expression profiles ( schwartz et al 2002 marquez et al 2005 )
we reported earlier kras braf mutations quite common low-grade serous ovarian carcinomas but rare conventional high-grade serous carcinomas ( nakayama et al 2006 )
our present results showing low frequencies either kras braf mutations conventional high-grade serous carcinoma consistent our earlier reports ( nakayama et al 2006 )
v600e most common braf mutation ovarian cancer ( singer et al 2003 sieben et al 2004 shih ie kurman 2005 nakayama et al 2006 )
however mutations e585k g463e been reported ovarian cancer samples cell lines ( davies et al 2002 )
therefore further studies needed clarify effects other braf mutations ovarian cancer completely describe mutation profile kras-braf signalling established ovarian cancer cell lines
study we showed erk?mapk pathway activated 15 (33.3%) out 45 ovarian carcinomas activation depended mutational status kras braf 
contrast recent report showing pathway frequently activated independent status kras braf endometrioid-type endometrial cancer ( mizumoto et al 2007 )
discrepancy may because differences organ-specific oncogenic pathways
ras?raf?mek?erk pathway may play important role ovarian carcinogenesis but not endometrial carcinogenesis
similarly alternative pathways erk activation such crosstalk pi3k pathway exist endometrial cancer but rare ovarian cancer
indeed pi3k signalling either pik3ca pten mutations occurs 40% endometrial cancers but <5% ovarian cancers ( tashiro et al 1997 oda et al 2005 kolasa et al 2006 nakayama et al 2006 )
study kras / braf mutations tended favourable but not statistically significant effect overall survival
our findings contrast recent report showing positive correlation between kras braf mutation clinical aggressiveness colorectal non-small-cell lung thyroid cancers ( lievre et al 2006 lee et al 2007 massarelli et al 2007 )
difference prognostic significance between ovarian cancer latter types intriguing probably reflects organ-specific roles kras/braf pathway
study 8 out 9 kras/braf mutations identified early stage (stage i ii) tumours
may reflect more indolent course tumours kras/braf mutations
earlier report advanced ovarian cancer patients (stage iii iv) p-erk expression longer overall survival patients low p-erk values ( hsu et al 2004 )
however we did not find significant correlation between p-erk expression overall survival our study
difference may because higher percentage early-stage ovarian cancers endometrioid mucinous histology tumours being included study compared earlier study
although biological roles ras?raf?mek?erk pathways human cancer been thoroughly investigated there been no recent studies
therefore not known whether activation kras braf mutations alters effects pathways tumour progression
study we carried out genotype?phenotype correlation ovarian cancer cells using mek inhibitor ci-1040
study we focussed ci-1040 because inhibited common downstream target ras signalling pathway
therefore ci-1040 potential developed drug treatment ovarian carcinomas patients either kras braf mutations
oral formulation ci-1040 already been shown effective mek inhibitor generally well tolerated multicentre phase ii study ( rinehart et al 2004 )
our results provide compelling evidence biological effects erk signalling pathway depend mutational status its upstream regulators (i.e.) kras braf genes
ovarian carcinomas mutations either kras braf more sensitive growth inhibition apoptosis induction mek inhibitor ci-1040
observation suggests ovarian carcinomas mutations either kras braf more highly dependent activation ras?raf?mek?erk pathway cell proliferation survival those without such mutations
thus inactivation erk1/2 results marked growth inhibition ovarian carcinomas mutations kras braf comparison only modest effect wild-type tumours
above observations lend strong support view ?kinase addiction' activating mutations kinase pathway confer susceptibility tumours inhibitor ( sebolt-leopold et al 1999 arteaga baselga 2004 )
microsatellite-unstable colorectal cancer cell lines effect braf inhibition depended whether cell harboured braf kras mutation
braf inhibition small interfering rna resulted significantly decreased proliferation increased apoptosis braf mutant lines
contrast effect not seen kras mutant lines ( preto et al 2008 )
cells carrying braf mutations been shown more sensitive mek inhibitors cells ras mutations ( solit et al 2006 )
raises possibility kras braf mutant cancer cells might differentially dependent signalling mechanisms involve mek
difference sensitivity ras?raf?mek?erk pathway between ovarian cancer latter types intriguing probably reflects organ-specific roles kras braf oncogenes
light our vivo vitro findings we propose ovarian cancer patients kras braf mutations considered mek inhibitor (ci-1040) therapy recur after conventional platinum taxane chemotherapy
thus far mek inhibitor ci-1040 fared poorly clinical trials breast colon lung cancer ( rinehart et al 2004 )
however its favourable therapeutic index high selectivity may outweigh its shortcomings kras braf mutant ovarian cancer
therefore we recommend further clinical trials mek inhibitors ovarian cancer patients stratified basis kras/braf mutational status
summary we shown phenotypic change ovarian carcinomas response erk1/2 inactivation depends mutational status kras braf 
findings study provide new insight biological roles ras?raf?mek?erk signalling pathway ovarian carcinomas
addition our observations important therapeutic implication ovarian cancer patients kras braf mutations
ovarian carcinomas kras braf mutation clinically low-grade carcinomas serous other histological subtypes often refractory conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy ( bristow et al 2002a 2002b winter et al 2007 )
therefore detection kras braf mutations ovarian cancers may identify patients who will benefit ci-1040 therapy.
