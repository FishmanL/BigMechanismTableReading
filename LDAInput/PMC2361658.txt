inactivation bmp pathway genes been implicated important several cancers
recent work shown bmp3b epigenetically inactivated cancer suggests bmp6 epigenetically inactivated
we investigated whether bmp6 epigenetically inactivated cell lines whether bmp3b bmp6 epigenetically inactivated non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc)
we studied relationship between bmp methylation k-ras mutation
here we demonstrate bmp3b bmp6 genes common targets epigenetic inactivation nsclc significantly more likely concurrently inactivated ( p =0.009)
furthermore coinactivation bmp3b bmp6 significantly associated mutation k-ras codon 12 lung cancer ( p =0.003) those k-ras mutation six times more likely concurrent methylation bmp loci
hence data suggest concurrent inactivation bmp activation ras signalling pathways important lung carcinogenesis

multivariate logistic regression conducted estimate relationship between methylation bmps k-ras mutation covariates statistically significant univariate analysis important biologically
effort determine whether transcription bmp6 gene inhibited promoter methylation we first examined transcriptional status bmp6 cell lines using rt?pcr ( figure 1a )
bmp6 mrna absent wtk1 normal human lymphoblastoid cells
following treatment 5-aza-deoxycytadine dna methyltransferase inhibitor transcription reactivated demonstrating loss transcription bmp6 due epigenetic inactivation ( figure 1b )
using primers designed specifically differentiate between methylated nonmethylated dna bmp6 gene promoter we demonstrated wtk1 cells methylated bmp6 gene promoter ( figure 1c )
we evaluated bmp3b bmp6 gene promoter methylation status 155 nsclc cases
consecutive case series we found 57% (88 out 155) 43% (67 out 155) nsclcs methylated bmp3b bmp6 gene promoters respectively
since both bmp3b bmp6 signal same pathways we tested whether there relationship between inactivation two genes
we found 52% (46/88) cases bmp3b methylation positive bmp6 methylation 31% (21/67) cases without bmp3b methylation positive bmp6 methylation
statistically significant association between concurrent methylation bmp3b bmp6 ( p =0.009) indicates epigenetic silencing genes does not occur independently lung cancer
we next investigated relationship between bmp epigenetic inactivation k-ras mutation
we previously reported k-ras mutation status cases ( nelson et al 1999 )
subset cases both k-ras bmp data 16% (24/147) mutated codon 12 k-ras gene bmp3b methylation significantly associated k-ras mutation ( table 1 p <0.03)
those bmp6 methylation more likely k-ras mutation but not statistically significant
however concurrent methylation both bmp3b bmp6 strongly associated k-ras mutation ( table 1 p <0.003)
k-ras mutation previously been associated asbestos exposure patients ( nelson et al 1999 )
addition pulmonary interstitial fibrosis (a condition associated asbestos exposure) associated activation bmp/smad signalling pathway ( matsuse et al 1996 rosendahl et al 2002 )
therefore we examined relationship between tobacco use asbestos exposure k-ras mutation epigenetic silencing bmps ( table 2 )
logistic regression analysis controlling histology gender showed tumours k-ras mutation six-fold more likely concurrent bmp3/6 silencing (or=6.0 95% confidence interval (ci) =2.0?17.9) asbestos exposure significantly decreased likelihood concurrent bmp3/6 methylation (or=0.2 ci 0.1?0.9 table 2 )
there no statistically significant relationship between bmp methylation tobacco exposure ( table 2 )
bmps well recognised play multiple crucial roles development diverse tissues
believed play role genesis many tumour types their inactivation allowing dysregulated cellular proliferation
there multiple bmps overlapping substrate specificity ( stott et al 1998 )
our data showing epigenetic inactivation bmp3b (at frequency similar previously reported ( dai et al 2004 )) bmp6 tend occur together lung cancer suggests nsclc multiple bmps may need silenced order abrogate their antigrowth signalling
increasing evidence shows there crosstalk between tgf ? /bmp antigrowth signalling ras/map-k progrowth signalling likely interaction pathways cell type tissue specific
some evidence suggests ras inactivates smad signalling while other evidence suggests ras activates smad signalling ( kretzschmar et al 1997 yue et al 1999 )
further inhibitory smads been shown upregulated coordination k-ras mutation epithelial cancer ( liu et al 2003 )
although exact relationship between bmps ras signalling unclear our data consistent mounting evidence relationship important solid tumours
finding asbestos exposure associated significantly different pattern signalling dysregulation nsclc supports notion clonal selection important nodal points influenced pattern carcinogen exposure
current work suggests ras bmp pathways part complex network inter-related interacting signalling proteins where multiple factors including carcinogen exposure determine precise character somatic genes inactivated particular tumour nsclc
case bmp inactivation there no apparent association methylation silencing tobacco exposure
however we identified inverse relationship between asbestos exposure bmp methylation
asbestos exposure been associated cytogenetic damage humans ( dusinska et al 2004 )
hence asbestos may selecting pathway inactivation via large-scale genetic changes
example smad4 effector protein bmp pathway been identified mutated deleted lung cancer ( nagatake et al 1996 et al 2002 )
asbestos associated induction smad4 inactivation lung cancer one would expect inverse association bmp silencing we observed
balance between antigrowth progrowth signalling imperative normal cell development homeostasis reliant upon multiple feedback signalling pathways
k-ras mutation been described relatively early event cancer ( nelson et al 1999 ) constitutively activates protein leading active growth signalling
our data show bmp pathway antiproliferative selected inactivation preferentially k-ras mutant tumours nsclc likely direct means potentiating progrowth signalling
direct experimental investigation interaction human cells description effects different carcinogens different tissues upon disruption signalling clearly indicated
will more precisely define aetiologic effects carcinogens (such asbestos) delineate interlocking pathways dysregulated solid tumours potentially open avenues prevention treatment often-fatal cancers.
