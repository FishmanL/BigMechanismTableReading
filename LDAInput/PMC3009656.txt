directly assess atf2's role melanoma development we crossed mouse melanoma model ( nras q61k::ink4a ?/? ) mice expressing transcriptionally inactive form atf2 melanocytes

melanoma tissue microarrays high nuclear atf2 mitf ratio primary specimens associated metastatic disease poor prognosis
our findings establish importance transcriptionally active atf2 melanoma development through fine-tuning mitf expression
malignant melanoma one most highly invasive metastatic tumors [1] its incidence been increasing higher rate other cancers recent years [2] 
significant advances understanding melanoma biology been made over past few years thanks identification genetic changes along mapk signaling pathway
those include mutations braf nras kit gnaq all result constitutively active mapk pathway [3] ? [5] 
consequently corresponding transcription factor targets such microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (mitf) [6] ap2 [7] c-jun [8] its heterodimeric partner atf2 [9] activated induce changes cellular growth motility resistance external stress [10] [11] 
addition constitutively active mapk/erk causes rewiring other signaling pathways [4] 
among examples rewired signaling upregulation c-jun expression activity [8] potentiates other pathways including pdk1 akt pkc plays critical role melanoma development [12] 
activating transcription factor 2 (atf2) member bzip family activated stress kinases including jnk p38 implicated transcriptional regulation immediate early genes regulating stress dna damage responses [13] ? [15] expression cell cycle control proteins [16] 
activate transcription atf2 heterodimerizes bzip proteins including c-jun creb [17] [18] both constitutively upregulated melanomas [8] 
atf2 implicated dna damage response through phosphorylation atm/atr [19] 
knock-in mice expressing form atf2 cannot phosphorylated atm more susceptible tumor development [20] 
nuclear localization atf2 melanoma tumor cells associated poor prognosis [21] likely due transcriptional activity constitutively active atf2
indeed expression transcriptionally inactive atf2 peptides attenuate endogenous atf2 activity inhibits melanoma development progression xenograft models [22] ? [26] 
studies suggest atf2 required melanoma development progression
transcription factor mitf been shown play central role melanocyte biology melanoma progression [27] [28] 
yet role mitf early stages melanoma development remains largely unexplored
factors controlling mitf transcription been well documented include transcriptional activators such sox10 creb pax3 lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (lef1 known tcf) onecut domain 2 (onecut-2) mitf itself [29] ? [33] well factors repress mitf transcription including brn2 foxd3 [34] [35] 
addition mitf subject several post translational modifications affect its availability activity including acetylation sumoylation ubiquitination [27] [28] 
directly assess importance atf2 melanoma development we employed mouse melanoma model atf2 selectively inactivated melanocytes
we demonstrate melanoma development markedly attenuated mice expressing transcriptionally inactive form atf2 melanocytes
surprisingly atf2 control melanoma development mediated part through its negative regulation sox10 consequently mitf transcription
inhibition atf2 abolished mutant braf-expressing melanocytes' ability form foci soft agar partially rescued when expression mitf attenuated
significance findings underscored our observation human melanoma tumors high ratio nuclear atf2 mitf expression associated poor prognosis
findings identify novel mechanism underlying melanocyte transformation melanoma development
global atf2 knockout mice leads early post-natal death [36] 
therefore cre-loxp system utilized disrupt atf2 melanocytes

elucidate role atf2 melanoma atf2 f/f mice crossed mice harboring 4-hydroxytamoxifen (oht)-inducible cre recombinase-estrogen receptor fusion transgene under control melanocyte-specific tyrosinase promoter designated tyr::cre er(t2) 
upon administration oht we predicted cre-mediated recombination would induced spatially temporally controlled manner embryonic melanoblasts melanocytes putative melanocyte stem cells [37] 
resulting atf2 f/f/tyr-cre er(t2) mice designated melanocyte-deleted (md) atf2 md ) indeed expressed gene encoding atf2 transcriptional mutant melanocytes
immunoblot analysis atf2 protein confirmed melanocytes prepared wild-type tyrcre+ ::atf2 +/+ ::nras + ::ink4a ?/? (wt) mice express 70 kda band corresponding full length atf2 whereas melanocytes tyrcre+ ::atf2 md ::nras + ::ink4a ?/? mice express only 55 kda band corresponding size atf2 lacking dna binding leucine zipper domains ( figure 1b )

similar findings reported ackermann et al
[39] mutant n-ras/ink4a ?/? mice developed melanoma within 8?12 weeks metastatic lesions often seen lymph nodes
however incidence melanoma lower tyr::cre er::nras q61k::ink4a ?/? mice used present study (50% penetrance 50% tumors confirmed melanoma) probably because expression mutant nras induced only after birth opposed activation nras during embryogenesis reported [39] )
thus atf2 md::n-ras q61k::ink4a ?/? mice used assess changes melanoma incidence absence functional atf2 over period up 8 months
all cases mouse skin treated tamoxifen within 3?5 days after birth inactivate atf2 ( figure 1b ) doxycycline their drinking water induce expression nras mutant transgene (see materials methods details figure 1c )

evaluate tumor type we examined melanoma markers including dct s100 all tumors ( figure 1e figure s1 )
analysis identified 55?63% tumors melanomas both atf2 +/+ (7/11) atf2 +/? (10/18) groups ( table 2 )
only one three tumors observed atf2 md group identified melanoma
kaplan meier curve did not reveal significant differences survival among different genotypes probably since study primarily designed follow tumor incidence
common all genotypes most tumors not identified melanomas fibrosarcomas lymphomas consistent previous reports [38]

assess mechanism underlying atf2's contribution melanoma development we conducted gene profiling array analysis primary melanocytes prepared tyr::cre +::atf2 +/+::nras q61k::ink4a ?/? tyr::cre +::atf2 md::nras q61k::ink4a ?/? mice
analysis limited melanocytes since reported above only one melanoma formed atf2 mutant group
all cases atf2 inactivated nras induced culture within 48h plating cells monitored western blots ( figure 1b 1c data not shown)

data provide initial indication atf2 negatively regulates mitf several other important pigmentation genes

data shown represents 2 biological 2 technical replicates array studies 3 replicates qpcr analyses (see materials methods details)
confirm atf2 negatively regulates mitf expression we assessed mitf transcription primary mouse melanocytes harboring wt ( tyr::cre ?::atf2 +/+ ) mutant ( tyr::cre +::atf2 md ) forms atf2
rna prepared whole skin mice (3 mice per group) subjected qpcr analysis
significantly mitf expression inversely correlated presence functional atf2 samples obtained atf2 mutant skin exhibited greater 2-fold increase mitf expression compared those obtained wt atf2 mice ( figure 2a )
likewise we found genes transcriptionally regulated mitf such dct silver tyrp1 upregulated skin mutant atf2 mice ( figure 2a )
degree altered expression pigmentation genes less pronounced whole skin samples cultured melanocytes ( table 3 ) probably due confounding effects vitro cell culture

given atf2 negatively regulates mitf melanocytes mouse human tissues related melanocyte cell lines we asked whether atf2 regulates mitf human melanoma cells
initially we assessed changes mitf expression six human melanoma lines harboring oncogenic mutations braf nras atf2 expression effectively inhibited corresponding shrna (shatf2)
all cases shrna specificity confirmed using three independent sequences (data not shown)
surprisingly six melanoma lines fell two classes based distinct patterns regulation mitf atf2 ( table 4 )
first class comprised four six melanoma cultures (1205lu wm35 wm793 wm1361) mitf expression elevated 3?6-fold following inhibition atf2 expression ( figure 3c s2a )
conversely second class cells including mewo 501mel cells exhibited decreased mitf expression after atf2 knockdown (kd) suggesting positive regulation mitf atf2 ( figure 3d s2b )
notably latter group showed high levels basal mitf expression [41] [42] suggesting regulation mitf expression cells differs mechanistically first group
further response stress (uv hypoxia) mewo 501mel lines further reduced mitf expression ( figure 3d data not shown) providing further evidence differential regulation mitf cells both prior response stress stimuli
additional analyses performed employing 12 more melanoma cell lines
inhibition atf2 expression revealed 4/12 exhibited increase mitf expression while 6/12 decreased mitf expression
two 12 lines did not exhibit change mitf expression following atf2 kd ( table 4 s5)
collectively out 18 melanoma lines we found 8 (44%) retained similar negative regulation mitf atf2 observed melanocytes
however another 8 (44%) exhibited positive regulation mitf atf2 pointing transcriptional switch occurred course melanocyte transformation
mitf not affected altered atf2 expression 2/18 cell lines ( table 4 figure s5 )
all about 50% melanoma cell lines atf2 elicits negative regulation mitf similar what seen human mouse melanocytes

mitf transcription regulated complex positive negative cues [27] 
instance while creb sox10 positively regulate mitf brn2 foxd3 been shown downregulate mitf expression [29] [30] [34] [35] 
hence we used melanocytes representative melanoma lines assess mechanisms underlying positive negative regulation mitf
infection human melanocyte line hermes 3a shatf2 effectively inhibited atf2 expression upregulated mitf transcription increased transcription sox10 foxd3 (from 7- 10-fold) lesser extent pax3 brn2 (from 1.5- 2-fold) ( figure 4a s3a )
similarly inhibition atf2 transcription human melanoma 1361 cells increased sox10 foxd3 transcription albeit lesser degree (3- 1.5-fold respectively) compared human melanocytes ( figure s3b )
neither brn2 nor pax3 transcription elevated melanoma cells atf2 expression inhibited ( figure s3a )

assess possible role foxd3 regulation mitf we inhibited foxd3 expression melanocytes expressing control shrna shatf2
inhibition foxd3 expression increased sox10 transcription protein expression albeit lower levels compared inhibition atf2 expression ( figure s4 )
concomitant increase mitf rna protein levels lower compared seen upon inhibition atf2 expression
notably inhibition both atf2 foxd3 resulted additive increase sox10 mitf ( figure s4 )
data suggest foxd3 may contribute negative regulation mitf melanocytes independent atf2
since inhibition foxd3 elicited less pronounced effect compared atf2 since effect appeared atf2-independent furthermore did not appear mediate similar changes human melanoma cells ( figure s3b data not shown) we focused assessment direct mechanisms underlying atf2 effect mitf transcription
end we first analyzed mitf promoter sequences atf2/cre elements (cyclic amp response element) targeted atf2 well sequences recognized brn2 sox10 using luciferase reporter construct (mitf-luc) [43] 
using either wild-type (wt) construct one brn2 site mutated we observed increased luciferase activity following inhibition atf2 transcription wm1361 melanoma ( figure 4b ) well lu1205 wm35 melanoma cells (data not shown)
relative increase luciferase activity following atf2 inhibition equivalent both constructs suggesting atf2 effect not mediated brn2 ( figure 4b left panel)
similarly mitf transcriptional activities altered similar degree following inactivation cre element ( figure 4b right panel) suggesting atf2 down-regulation mitf promoter indirect
we therefore assessed whether sox10 positively regulates mitf whose transcription markedly increases melanocytes melanoma cells atf2 expression inhibited ( figure 4a s3b ) may mediate atf2 effect mitf transcription
analysis mitf-luc construct harboring mutant sox10 binding site revealed atf2 inhibition no longer elicited increased mitf transcription human melanocytes melanoma cells ( figure 4c )
agreement inhibition sox10 expression corresponding sirna attenuated increase mitf transcription seen shatf2-expressing human melanocytes ( figure 4d ) melanoma cells ( figure 4e )
results suggest atf2 regulation mitf transcription mediated sox10

putative response element ap1 (which serve atf2 response element through atf2 heterodimerization jun family members [9] ) been identified upstream regions sox10 promoter [44] 
we examined potential atf2 binding element chip found endogenous atf2 but not atfa binds ap1 sequence (?4797?4791) both human melanocytes melanoma cells ( figure 5b )
we next set identify atf2 heterodimeric partner could mediate negative regulation sox10 transcription
among members jun family implicated transcriptional silencing junb
thus further assessment performed determine junb functions atf2 heterodimerization partner regulate sox10 transcription through ap1 site
chip analysis confirmed junb binds ap1 site found sox10 promoter sequences ( figure 5c )
confirm possible role junb regulating mitf transcription we asked whether expression tam67 negative regulator jun family members could attenuate binding transcriptional activities elicited junb
expression tam67 indeed reduced degree atf2 junb binding ap1 site sox10 promoter
further kd atf2 expression abolished binding both atf2 junb ap1 site sox10 promoter ( figure 5c )
data confirm presence atf2-junb complex sox10 promoter suggest atf2 recruits junb binding ap1 site sox10 promoter
assess role junb sox10 transcription we monitored changes sox10 expression protein rna levels
expression tam67 caused increased expression sox10 both human melanoma (?2 folds figure 5d ) melanocytes (?3 folds figure 5e ) indicating some relief junb inhibition
co-expression tam67 jun b attenuated increase reducing level sox10 expression basal levels ( figure 5d 5e )
over-expression junb but not jun d effectively inhibited sox10 expression both melanoma melanocytes cells ( figure 5d 5e )
data suggest junb mediates inhibition sox10 expression
further reveal role atf2 inhibition we assessed effect junb sox10 expression cells expressing control shrna shatf2
while ectopic expression junb reduced expression sox10 control shrna-expressing cells such decrease no longer seen cells expressing shatf2 ( figure 5f )
collectively findings suggest atf2 concert junb responsible inhibition sox10 expression
we next assessed effect atf2 sox10 mitf expression 12 additional human melanoma cell lines
all cases cells infected shatf2 changes sox10 mitf monitored level rna
notably about 4/12 melanoma lines revealed increase both sox10 mitf expression upon kd atf2 ( figure s5 table 4 )
contrast 6/12 melanoma lines revealed decrease mitf expression 5 shown decrease sox10 expression pointing positive regulation sox10 mitf melanoma cells
two out 12 melanoma lines atf2 affected sox10 but not mitf transcription ( figure s5 )
overall our cohort 18 melanoma lines revealed about 50% melanomas retained negative regulation mitf atf2 seen melanocytes (primary cell lines) ( table 4 )
further assess whether atf2 regulation mitf sox10-dependent melanocytes melanoma cells we coexpressed sox10 shatf2-expressing cells
seen earlier analysis inhibition atf2 expression caused increase mitf transcription human melanocytes 4 melanoma cell lines (wm1361 wm793 lu1205 wm35 figure s6 )
notably melanocytes 2/4 melanoma cell lines revealed atf2 effect mitf expression sox10-dependent (wm1361 wm793 figure s6 )
two four melanoma cell lines did not reveal increased sox10 expression although retained increased mitf expression upon inhibition atf2 (lu1205 wm35 figure s6 )
findings confirm while melanocytes expression sox10 mitf negatively regulated atf2 mechanism conserved approximately half melanomas surveyed
along lines two melanoma lines (mewo 501 mel) exhibit positive regulation mitf atf2 exhibited positive regulation sox10 atf2 ( figure s7 )
inhibition atf2 expression reduced sox10 mitf rna protein levels ( figure s7a?c )
order determine whether junb lost its ability elicit negative regulation sox10 mitf melanoma cells where atf2 no longer inhibited sox10 mitf expression we transfected those cell lines tam67 junb alone combination
cells whereas tam67 effectively attenuated sox10 mitf expression junb did not alter expression genes suggesting positive regulation mitf sox10 atf2 depends other members jun family transcription factors ( figure s7d )
conversely tam67 junb no effect melanoma cells atf2 inhibits mitf independently sox10 suggesting cases atf2 likely cooperates transcription factors other junb elicit negative regulation sox10 mitf ( figure s7d )
consistent observation chip assay confirmed atf2 creb but not junb binding sox10 promoter cells ( figure s7e )
findings suggest changes atf2 heterodimeric partner (from junb creb) likely cause switch negative positive regulation sox10 turn mitf (see below)
possibility altered expression junb may account atf2 positive negative regulation sox10 mitf excluded no clear correlation between junb expression ability atf2 elicit negative regulation sox10/mitf seen ( figure s7f )
among response elements potentially required upregulate mitf transcription cre element implicated creb-mediated upregulation mitf transcription [45] 
although transcriptional activity cre mutant mitf promoter lower compared wt promoter (30%) no longer responsive inhibition atf2 expression mewo cells ( figure s8a )
pull-down assays using biotin-tagged mitf promoter sequences harboring cre identified atf2 creb cre-bound proteins mewo melanoma cells ( figure s8b )
agreement chip analysis confirmed occupancy cre site mitf promoter atf2 ( figure s8c )
findings consistent fact atf2 heterodimerizes creb [9] report p38/mapk14 (which phosphorylates atf2) plays important role mitf transcription dependent cre site [46] 
results establish atf2-dependent activation mitf transcription melanoma cells mediated through cre site likely cooperation creb
notably mewo 501mel lines known express high mitf levels compared other melanoma lines [41] [42] suggesting cells harbor distinct mechanisms preclude negative regulation mitf atf2
determine whether contribution atf2 melanocyte transformation development mitf-dependent we assessed melanocytes' ability grow form colonies soft agar indicative their transformed potential
expression mutant brafv600e immortal melanocytes reportedly sufficient growth soft agar [47] 
thus we infected melan-ink4a-arf1 melanocytes mutant braf ( figure 6a ) confirmed their ability form colonies soft agar
mutant braf expression effectively caused formation about 1000 colonies per 5000 cells ( figure 6b 6c )
contrast melanocytes infected braf600e shatf2 formed average about 20 colonies indicative loss tumorigenicity ( figure 6b 6c 6d ) consistent our initial observation number melanoma tumors significantly decreases absence transcriptionally functional atf2 ( tables 1 ? 2 )
determine importance mitf early stage melanocyte transformation we inhibited mitf expression (using shrna) melanocytes expressing mutant braf alone mutant braf+shatf2
significantly inhibition mitf expression decreased number braf-induced foci (from 1000 about 100 per well)
over-expression mitf braf-expressing melanocytes inhibited focus formation degree similar seen following inhibition mitf expression ( figure 6b 6c 6d )
observation implies effective inhibition overexpression mitf attenuates melanocyte transformation consistent previous reports (52)
remarkably inhibition mitf expression melanocytes expressing both mutant braf shatf2 rescued least partially melanocytes' ability form foci soft agar (400 compared 20 seen shatf2 cells figure 6b 6c 6d )
findings suggest inhibition mitf expression melanocytes lacking atf2 expression promote transformation
mitf inhibition melanocytes expressing atf2 wt attenuate their ability form foci soft agar attributable relative expression mitf rna protein condition ( figure 6d )
mitf expression levels atf2 kd cells increased 7.5-fold compared control braf-expressing melanocytes
inhibition mitf expression atf2 kd melanocytes reduced mitf expression 2.5-fold relative controls whereas mitf kd alone resulted lower mitf expression (5-fold figure 6d )
thus complete abrogation mitf expression attenuates melanocyte transformation whereas low moderate levels mitf expression sufficient promote growth soft agar
higher mitf expression levels seen atf2 kd cells result total loss melanocytes' ability form foci soft agar
findings line proposed rheostat model medium levels mitf optimal growth melanoma development [48] agreement our observations mouse melanoma model

we next assessed whether inhibition melanocyte growth soft agar altered atf2 and/or mitf expression attributed decreased proliferation increased apoptosis
inhibition atf2 expression caused notable accumulation cells g2 (60%) significant cell death induction (22%) compared controls (4%) ( figure 6e 6f )
interestingly such altered cell cycle distribution cell death rate associated significant increase mitf protein levels ( figure 6d )
contrast inhibition mitf expression did not significantly induce cell death (6.5%) but resulted fewer cells g2/m-phase more cells g1 compared inhibition atf2 alone
observations suggest mitf inhibition sufficient reduce rate cell cycle progression through g2/m phase inhibited growth braf600e-expressing melanocytes soft agar may attributed abrogation distinct cell cycle-regulatory mechanisms
combined inhibition atf2 mitf restored cell cycle distribution seen control melanocytes reduced cell death 22.4% 12.9%
interest mitf overexpression promoted similar degree cell death (11.4%) without altering cell cycle distribution similar combined inhibition atf2 mitf ( figure 6e 6f )
together observations suggest simultaneous inhibition atf2 mitf averts cell cycle abrogation induced when expression either factors perturbed individually further substantiating regulation mitf atf2
availability melanoma tma consisting over 500 melanoma samples expression both atf2 mitf same tumors been measured enabled us assess possible associations between atf2 mitf their correlation survival other clinical pathological factors
our earlier studies revealed atf2 subcellular localization tumors significantly correlated prognosis: nuclear localization reflecting constitutively active atf2 associated metastasizing tumors poor outcome [7] 
here we quantitated immunofluorescent staining tmas mitf atf2 employing our automated quantitative (aqua) method

nuclear mitf single discriminator not significant predictor survival (p?=?0.185) reported previously using immunohistochemistry [49] 
observations suggest active (nuclear) atf2 melanoma suppress mitf expression phenomenon associated poor prognosis

identifying mechanisms underlying early phases melanocyte transformation melanoma development central understanding etiology devastating tumor well developing novel treatment approaches
previous studies indicate presence mutant braf melanocytic lesions well its effect pigment gene expression [6] [50] [51] 
present study enhances our understanding early events contributing melanoma development
we demonstrate loss transcriptionally active form atf2 melanocytes inhibits melanoma development nras/ink4a model
our quest understand mechanisms underlying atf2 activity process led us identify important role atf2 regulation mitf important regulator melanocyte biogenesis factor implicated melanoma progression [49] 
surprisingly atf2 negatively regulated mitf expression mouse human melanocytes suggesting atf2 transcriptional activities limit mitf expression
we demonstrate such negative regulation elicited through downregulation sox10 atf2 cooperation junb
putative ap1 response element been identified sox10 promoter sequences chip analysis domain showed atf2 junb binding
overexpression junb efficiently suppressed sox10 expression atf2-dependent manner inhibition jun transcriptional activities phenocopied effect shatf2 suggesting negative regulation sox10 atf2 direct mediated cooperation junb
importantly atf2-dependent negative regulation sox10 consequently mitf seen melanocytes but only about 50% 18 melanoma cell lines studied here
correspondingly junb required atf2-dependent inhibition sox10 transcription no longer found promoter sox10 melanoma cells (i.e
501mel) exhibit positive regulation atf2
rather creb atf2 found sox10 mitf promoters pointing switch atf2 heterodimeric partners enable positive regulation genes
notably melanoma cell lines exhibit positive regulation sox10 mitf atf2 show high basal levels mitf expression [41] [42] suggesting additional genetic epigenetic changes distinguish lines melanocytes other melanoma lines atf2 elicits negative regulation mitf
notably atf2 control mitf expression affected ability braf600e-expressing melanocytes exhibit transformed phenotype culture monitored their ability grow soft agar
inhibition atf2 abolished soft agar growth braf600e-expressing melanocytes partially rescued upon kd mitf
interestingly both over expression kd mitf resulted inhibition melanocytes ability grow soft agar substantiating notion fine balance mitf expression must maintained order ensure its contribution cellular proliferation transformation
we propose excessively low high mitf levels block melanocyte transformation whereas intermediate levels allow transformation occur
overall our observations demonstrate atf2 plays important role fine-tuning those levels support rheostat model proposed mitf's role melanoma development progression [48] 
importance atf2 mitf affect ability braf600e-expressing melanocytes grow soft agar via distinct mechanisms
whereas specific inhibition atf2 causes both accumulation cells g2 induction cell death specific alteration mitf protein levels?particularly depletion?significantly affects cell proliferation inhibit growth soft agar non-lethally slowing cell cycle progression g2/m
observations consistent report wellbrock marais [52] who showed altered mitf expression inhibits melanocyte proliferation
importantly inhibiting mitf expression atf2 kd melanocytes sufficient partially rescue melanocyte growth soft agar
while supportive our finding nras::ink4a mouse melanoma model where expression transcriptionally inactive atf2 inhibits melanoma formation observations provide foundation model atf2 inhibition causes increased mitf levels concomitant inhibition melanocyte growth possible induction cell death delayed development
latter suggested ihc analysis mouse skin atf2 md mice shows notably reduced s100 staining indicative delayed melanocyte development: atf2 ko melanocytes appear represent anagen stage iv whereas wt represent anagen stage vi
delay seen 4- but not 14-day time point suggesting atf2 effect might limited specific subpopulation phase melanocyte development
early (4 day) time point within time frame allows induction melanoma development uv-irradiation c-met h-ras mutant mice [53] 
therefore plausible timely control mitf expression atf2 determines melanocyte susceptibility transformation
our analysis genes whose expression altered atf2 kd melanocytes identified cluster pigmentation genes many reportedly regulated mitf [6] [54] 
therefore changes tyrp1 dct silver expression could attributed altered mitf expression
however initial analysis points more complex mechanism since (i) degree changes expression genes often greater seen mitf (ii) expression some pigmentation genes found independent mitf some melanoma melanocyte cultures
hence further studies required address mechanisms underlying atf2 regulation pigmentation genes significance such regulation melanocyte transformation melanoma development
while our present studies focused atf2-mitf axis expected additional atf2-regulated genes contribute melanoma development [12] 
agreement our earlier studies using both human mouse melanoma lines demonstrate inhibition atf2 effectively inhibits tumorigenesis blocks metastasis [22] ? [26] 
important atf2 function its subcellular localization
while findings presented here position atf2 oncogene functioning melanocyte transformation melanoma development earlier studies our laboratory others suggest keratinocytes mammary glands atf2 elicits tumor suppressor function [55] [56] 
interest assessing localization atf2 melanoma cell lines studied here revealed all express nuclear atf2
interestingly most cases nuclear staining revealed punctate staining resembling localization atf2 dna repair foci following dna damage ( figure s9 )
possible link between presence atf2 repair foci most melanoma cells points possible presence activated dna damage response may associated genomic instability [19] [20] ?aspects will explored future studies
significantly appearance nuclear atf2 correlated poor prognosis melanoma whereas melanomas exhibit cytosolic atf2 exhibit better survival
notably cytosolic atf2 primarily seen non-malignant skin tumors [55] 
here we demonstrate high nuclear atf2/mitf ratios associated poor prognosis primary melanomas but not metastatic melanomas
latter finding attests important role atf2 plays control mitf expression early phase melanocyte transformation melanoma development
overall using mutant nras / ink4a melanoma model we provide genetic evidence central role atf2 melanoma development
we demonstrate absence transcriptionally active atf2 melanoma formation largely inhibited
furthermore our data point unexpected role atf2 fine-tuning mitf transcription through regulation its positive regulator sox10
mouse melanoma models vitro transformation studies indicate newly identified regulatory pathway required early phases melanocyte transformation
given atf2 affects activity oncogenes n-ras (mouse model) braf (melanocyte growth soft agar) we expect atf2 play significant roles melanomas carry either mutations
