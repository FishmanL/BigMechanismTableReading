signaling downstream ras mediated three major pathways raf/erk phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (pi3k) ral guanine nucleotide exchange factor (ralgef)
ras signal transduction pathways play important role breast cancer progression evidenced frequent over-expression ras-activating epidermal growth factor receptors egfr erbb2
here we investigated signal transduction pathways downstream ras contribute egfr-dependent transformation telomerase-immortalized mammary epithelial cells hme16c
furthermore we examined whether highly transcriptionally regulated erk pathway target phlda1 (tdag51) suggested tumor suppressor breast cancer melanoma might modulate transformation process

our results suggest multiple ras signal transduction pathways contribute mammary epithelial cell transformation but erk signaling pathway may crucial component downstream egfr activation during tumorigenesis

signaling differences between tumor normal cells reflected altered gene expression patterns finding been widely investigated using various molecular techniques
patterns differential gene expression been used classification prognostication certain cancers may valuable prospectively predicting responsiveness therapeutic treatments [ 1 ]
addition serving biomarkers some differentially expressed gene products been informative defining physiological differences between normal cancer cells
order understand impact dysregulated signaling pathways upon gene expression function necessary connect differential gene expression upstream signaling pathways
ras activation common intermediary signaling pathways initiated variety cell surface receptors signaling pathways downstream ras been implicated repeatedly oncogenesis
ras proteins frequently mutated activated form human cancers particularly tumors pancreas colon thyroid lung [ 2 ]
ras mutations rare breast cancer where mutation rate less 5% [ 3 ]
however ras signaling hyperactive many primary breast tumors [ 4 ]
most likely due activation growth factor receptors activate ras exchange factors such epidermal growth factor receptors egfr (erbb1) erbb2 (her2/neu) colony stimulating factor-1 (csf-1) receptor c-fms [ 5 6 ]
egfr erbb2 receptor over-expression occurs one quarter one-half all breast tumors correlates significantly decreased disease-free overall survival rates [ 5 7 ]
addition ligands egfr such transforming growth factor-a amphiregulin epiregulin betacellulin heparin-binding egf stimulate receptor primary breast tumors enhance local growth progression disease [ 8 ]

ras oncogene binds numerous effectors turn activate variety signaling pathways
most highly characterized raf proteins pi3k ral guanidine nucleotide exchange factors (ralgefs) although ras does recruit activate other potentially transforming effectors [ 11 ]
dissection individual ras signaling pathways possible using effector domain mutants (edms) ras single amino acid mutations effector binding domain allow binding activation specific effectors but not others [ 12 ]
ras edms together activated dominant-negative versions downstream effectors been used characterize pathways contribute transformation immortalized cells
mammary epithelial cells both species- well cell line-dependent differences ras downstream signaling pathways been found induce tumorigenesis and/or anchorage-independent growth measure vitro transformation
studies using immortalized mouse eph4 mammary epithelial cells implicated raf well pi3k pathways supporting transformation tumorigenesis [ 13 ]
human immortalized mammary epithelial cells raf pi3k clearly contribute transformation although usually not sufficient tumor formation animal models [ 14 15 ]

complete inhibition colony formation rasv12g37-infected rasv12c40-infected cells observed 0.25 ?m pd153035 concentration specifically inhibits egfr [ 28 ] whereas both rasv12- rasv12s35-infected cells formed colonies efficiently same concentration inhibitor (figure 3a 3b )
identical results found egfr-specific inhibitor pd168393 used 0.1 ?m concentration specifically inhibits egfr her-2 receptors [ 29 ](not shown)
similarly treatment cells grown ultra-low-attachment plates demonstrated egfr inhibition substantially inhibited growth rasv12g37-and rasv12c40-expressing cells relative rasv12- rasv12s35-expressing hme16c (figure 2c )

since cell growth under anchorage-independent conditions balance between cell proliferation cell death we sought evaluate effect upon cellular death tdag51 knock-down
we used assay cellular cytotoxicity measures release lactose deydrogenase enzyme ldh
ldh release increased tdag51 shrna-expressing rasv12s35 cells relative plvthm-infected cells various time points after initiation matrix-detached growth (figure 8 )
difference ldh release tdag51 shrna-expressing rasv12 cells minimal rarely approached statistical significance
sub-g1 peaks indicative dead cells sometimes seen cell cycle analysis late time points but varied experiment experiment
therefore rasv12s35-infected cells differences cell growth after tdag51 reduction under anchorage-independent conditions resulted enhanced rate cellular proliferation exceeded concomitant increase cell death

reducing tdag51 protein levels erk-driven cellular transformation enhanced cell growth under anchorage-independent but not attached conditions
test whether tdag51 might affect proximal erk signaling we examined activation status erk cells expressing tdag51-specific shrna
interestingly levels phosphorylated erk enhanced when tdag51 protein levels reduced rasv12s35 rasv12 cells grown under anchorage-independent but not attached conditions (figure 9 )
fact activation status erk unchanged cells grown under attached conditions suggests reducing tdag51 expression no selective effect regard erk activation cells
rather enhanced activation erk specific anchorage-independent growth conditions

ras common signaling node various cell surface receptors contribute epithelial cell transformation [ 14 ]
study we used htert-immortalized human mammary epithelial cell line hme16c examine ras signaling pathways sufficient transformation identify transcriptional targets downstream those pathways might modulate phenotype
transduction hme16c pathway-discriminating ras effector domain mutants demonstrated multiple downstream ras signal transduction pathways contribute anchorage-independent growth including raf- ralgef- pi3k-mediated signaling
transformation hme16c rasv12g37 effector domain mutant but not activated rlf-caax suggest rasv12g37-binding effectors other ralgef contribute mammary epithelial transformation
microarray analyses rasv12 ras effector domain mutant transduced cells demonstrated common upregulation egfr ligands among transformed cell lines
suggested autocrine egfr ligand secretion important component ras-mediated cellular transformation
following blockade egfr signaling egfr-specific inhibitor pd153035 only pathway downstream ras promoted anchorage-independent growth raf/erk suggesting raf activation able substitute egfr activity cell line
contrast previous studies mcf10a cells demonstrated egfr tyrosine kinase activity necessary inhibit anoikis upon matrix detachment even cells expressing activated raf [ 16 ]
contrast under matrix detached conditions parental hme16c cells non-proliferative but do not actively undergo anoikis
studies here measure proliferative response raf/erk activation absence strong apoptotic component
addition blockade mek activity mek-specific inhibitor pd98059 prevented transformation rasv12- rasv12s35-expressing cells
taken together finding rasv12- rasv12s35-transduced hme16c cells able form tumors nude mice indicates raf-mek-erk axis plays crucial role mediating transformation tumorigenesis model
however should noted ras-transformed hme16c well similar hmler [ 32 ] give rise squamous metaplasias not adenocarcinomas
been hypothesized hmle human mammary epithelial cells represent distinct precursor population those mammary epithelial cells give rise glandular adenocarcinomas predominant form breast cancer [ 32 ]
significantly reduced tumorigenicity rasv12s35- compared rasv12- expressing cells emphasizes importance cooperation between ras signal transduction pathways fully transformed phenotype
following egfr inhibition rasv12c40- rasv12g37- transduced lines lost anchorage-independent growth suggesting non-erk signaling pathways contribute cellular transformation through egfr dependent mechanism
indeed one consequence egfr activation erk pathway activation may explain role egfr cooperating rasv12g37- rasv12c40-mediated cell signaling promote anchorage-independent growth
microarray analyses identified up-regulation phlda1 gene product being correlated erk-mediated cellular transformation
likewise protein product phlda1 gene tdag51 displayed identical expression pattern
expression phlda1 mrna tdag51 protein breast cancer recently been described [ 17 ]
using tdag51 immunohistochemistry tissue microarrays 699 individual primary invasive breast tumor specimens examined loss tdag51 found correlate poorer disease-free overall survival rate multivariate analysis
similar results been found small series melanomas where tdag51 immunoreactivity found decrease during progression melanocytic nevi primary melanomas finally metastatic melanoma [ 18 ]
studies suggest tdag51 suppressive effect tumor progression prompted us evaluate cell biological function tdag51 hme16c transformation model
phlda1 gene member pleckstrin homology-related domain family includes ipl/tssc tih [ 33 ]
phdla1 been described immediate early gene transcriptional activation resulting engagement receptors such fgf igf tyrosine kinase receptors t-cell receptor [ 34 - 36 ]
strong tdag51 induction rasv12s35 transformation mammary epithelial cells suggests erk activation may least partially explain tdag induction previous reports
vitro studies suggested role tdag51 control cellular proliferation induction apoptosis response variety stresses including proteotoxic cellular stresses such lung cancer cell responses chemotherapy[ 35 37 - 39 ]
overexpression tdag51 been shown reduce cell proliferation induce cell death variety cell types including t cells neuronal endothelial melanoma cervical carcinoma cell types [ 34 35 38 ]
contrast tdag51 functioned anti-apoptotic factor downstream insulin-like growth factor receptor (igfr) signaling tdag51 required protect nih3t3 cells apoptosis upon igf-1 withdrawal [ 36 ]
reduction tdag51 levels rasv12 rasv12s35 cells enhanced cell proliferation under anchorage-independent conditions
suggests tdag51 expression limits cellular proliferation
addition enhancing cellular proliferation reduction tdag51 protein levels increased absolute amount cell death transformed rasv12s35 cells under same conditions
therefore tdag51 loss context oncogene activation may indirectly promote cell death consequence enhanced cell cycling
however overall increased cell numbers anchorage-independent conditions showed enhanced cellular proliferation exceeded enhanced cell death
interestingly decrease tdag51 expression during ras-mediated cellular transformation promoted growth cells under anchorage-independent conditions but did not affect growth attached cells
suggests tdag51 might act conjunction both cellular stress case matrix detachment proliferative signal case oncogenic activation
other studies implicated tdag51 functioning during cellular stress survival particularly endoplasmic reticulum stress associated unfolded protein response [ 37 38 ]
mechanism action tdag51 not known
preliminary finding tdag51 binds proteins involved protein translation been used suggest tdag51 may play role regulating protein synthesis response proteotoxic stress [ 40 ]
reduction tdag51 expression resulted increase erk activation cells grown under anchorage-independent conditions
how tdag51 expression might suppress erk signaling not known but appears represent negative feedback pathway directly indirectly limits erk activation
not likely due inhibition erk protein synthesis tdag51 since erk2 levels unaffected reduced tdag51
however another important component erk activation dual specific erk phosphatases highly regulated class proteins whose relative level activity may affected tdag51 protein levels
understanding mechanisms tdag51 regulates erk pathway activation balance between cellular proliferation apoptosis transformed cells represents future challenge
finally tdag51 acts suppressive manner during matrix-detached growth hme16c cells
taken together identification tdag51 stress-induced gene variety cell lines growth inhibitor melanoma cell lines reasonable suggest loss tdag51 may act promote progression breast cancer through intrinsic growth regulatory mechanism
expression activated ras effector domain mutants bind raf pi3k ralgef sufficient induce anchorage-independent growth human mammary epithelial cell line hme16c associated up-regulation egfr ligands
however only erk pathway capable supporting transformation absence egfr signaling supporting tumorigenesis nude mice
up-regulation tdag51 occurs during ras-mediated transformation erk-dependent fashion but opposes erk-mediated transformation suppressing erk signaling decreasing cellular proliferation under matrix-detached conditions
therefore model mammary epithelial cell transformation tdag51 acts growth inhibitor erk-driven proliferation may help explain why loss tdag51 expression been found correlate progression human breast cancer melanoma
