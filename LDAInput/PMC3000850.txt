egfr/her2 signaling pathway exerts its biological effects via multiple signaling cascades including phospholipase c ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase (camk/pkc) ras/raf/mitogen/activated proteine kinases (mapk) phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (pi3k)/akt/mammalian target rapamycin (mtor) pi3k/akt/gsk janus-associated kinase (jak)/signal transducer activator transcription protein (stats) [ 6 - 8 ]

furthermore incidence k-ras mutation particularly low (6.1%)
interestingly changes involving codon 12 frequently mutated other tumor types not found our series
previous studies k-ras mutations cholangiocarcinoma revealed divergent results [ 31 - 35 ]
higher occurrence k-ras mutations found japan germany (ranging 39% 54%) relative other areas such thailand (from 0% 8%) tumor occurred high frequency
geographical differences etiology carcinogenesis btcs might explain variability
we observed lower incidence b-raf mutations compared reported tannapfel coworkers (8% vs

we identified pi3k mutations 4 cases (8.2%) pten mutations 2 cases (4.1%)
multiple mutations egfr transducers observed some samples
namely total 14 mutations found 8 tumor samples only 3 samples single point mutation
consistent previous reports [ 37 38 ] k-ras egfr mutations not present same sample but contrast another report [ 36 ] k-ras b-raf mutations simultaneously present one case
however due genetic heterogeneity tumor subclones we cannot exclude mutations would present two distinct cell populations
we observed rare frequency pten mutations we did not find any loss pten protein expression comparison normal cholangiocytes rather stronger labeling intensity high percentage labeled cells significantly present tumor cells compared normal counterparts
particular samples displaying egfr pathway activation due transducer mutations highest percentage pten-labeled cells suggesting preserved pten function might counteract egfr downstream pathway activation

our study dual inhibition egfr her2 induced lapatinib less effective treatment erlotinib gefitinib ecc cell lines

everolimus effective all tested cell lines but not huh28
nonetheless everolimus inhibited phosphorylation mtor all cell lines

moreover egfr/her2 pathway inhibitors synergistic effect gemcitabine treatment
mtor inhibition gave rise strong synergistic effect combination gemcitabine extrahepatic cell lines
chung et al demonstrated more 80% extrahepatic btc displayed mtor activation [ 49 ] correlated poor prognosis
interestingly egfr inhibitor erlotinib able overcome resistance gemcitabine intrahepatic cell line huh28 fact intrahepatic specimens showed highest egfr expression
