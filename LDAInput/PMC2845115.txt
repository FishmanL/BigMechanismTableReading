clinicaltrials.gov: nsabp c-07: nct00004931 recent evidence suggests mutation profiling assist prognosis prediction colon cancer
kras pik3ca braf mutations frequent tumors colon been associated poor prognosis [ 1 - 6 ]
however results remain controversial because other studies shown mutations genes not prognostic
large study meta analysis kras mutations found only kras g12v bad prognostic marker other kras mutations not associated bad prognosis [ 2 ]
evidence demonstrated kras mutations potential markers prediction because tumors kras mutations significantly associated resistance egfr antibody based therapies [ 7 - 11 ]
publications reported same phenomenon braf pik3ca mutations although observations still not well established [ 12 13 ]
published study suggesting braf mutant tumors resistant egfr therapies small study [ 13 ]
predictive value pik3ca mutations remains controversial other publications shown mutations no predictive value [ 14 15 ]
inconsistencies together two other factors limited impact mutation profiling prognosis prediction standard care colon cancer
large sample size required establish gene mutation significant impact patient prediction prognosis
another limitation until recently conducting such large studies standard sequencing technologies too time consuming too expensive practical clinical studies
moreover while high frequency kras braf pik3ca mutations colon cancer well documented other potentially important mutations not been profiled large number clinical samples
whole genome sequencing small number colon samples demonstrated somatic cancer mutations consist few genes occur frequently many more mutations occur very infrequently many different genes [ 16 17 ]
mutations infrequently mutated genes could similar effect synergize mutations kras pik3ca braf 
given considerations our goal find cost-effective high throughput methodology would detect frequent infrequent cancer mutations genes large number samples
furthermore essential methodology would work degraded dnas isolated ffpet
mass spectrometric snp genotyping technology based sequenom platform provided ideal choice mutation profiling address several criteria
been shown work small amounts degraded dnas (5 ng) high multiplexing capacity minimizes use irreplaceable clinical samples
addition variety studies demonstrated sensitivity mass spectrometric methods exceeds traditional sanger sequencing highly concordant sanger sequencing pyrosequencing allele-specific pcr [ 16 18 19 ]
furthermore sequenom recently developed oncocarta panel oncogene panel offers rapid parallel analysis 238 simple complex cancer mutations across 19 genes
oncocarta panel includes assays most colon cancer mutations clinically relevant genes braf (99%) kras (98%) pik3ca (78%) addition contains assays other cancer mutations genes intersect same pathways kras braf pik3ca such akt1 egfr hras nras met others

observation provides evidence mutation data obtained sequenom platform accurate
our results demonstrate majority colon cancer samples aberrant pik(3) - ras/raf network similar results been seen previously [ 6 ]
mutations abl1 met not previously identified colon cancer identified 13 other genes screened found not mutated hot spot locations
furthermore study identified most frequent colon cancer mutations oncocarta providing necessary information reduce number assays 187 24 creating smaller more specific economical panel requiring less dna thus conserving precious clinical samples

two types assays been designed oncocarta panel referred simple complex
simple assays those single assay able detect amino acid changes codon
complex assays those require more one assay identify codon changes deletions insertion thus able detect multiple different amino acid substitutions deletions
example complex assay kras_ 1 kras _2 interrogate 2 different nucleotide positions within codon 12 together identify all codon 12 amino acid changes
much more complex assays included oncocarta interrogate insertions deletions within egfr gene

colocarta panel * hras _6 included panel but occurred < 0.1% samples
majority tumors (64%) contained least one more mutations following genes: braf kras nras met pik3ca 18% 2 more mutations
most common double mutation kras pik3ca followed pik3ca braf (table 4 )
most samples pik3ca mutations (80%) mutations other genes most frequent kras other mutated genes braf met nras second pik3ca mutation (table 2 last column)
tumors met nras mutations unexpectedly high frequency co-occurring mutations suggests occur second mutation perhaps later etiology tumor
many tumors contain only kras braf mutation consistent previous reports finding mutations earlier stages colon cancer [ 23 24 ]
multiple mutation frequencies tumors kras pik3ca pik3ca braf slightly higher lower respectively expected based their individual frequencies (table 4 )
conversely expected double mutation frequency braf kras would 5.1% based our data but combination not found agreement previous reports [ 24 ] (table 4 )
single double mutations c-07 samples co-occurring mutations ratios kras mutation ratio ( kras mutation peak area/total peak area) pik3ca mutation ratio ( pik3ca mutation peak area/total peak area) determined
twenty-two out 31 samples (71%) kras / pik3ca ratios above 1.25 (table 5 )
pik3ca mutations more prevalent only 2 out 31 samples
differences demonstrate majority primary tumors double mutations kras pik3ca kras mutations more prevalent pik3ca 
unequal distribution mutant alleles within tumor may due fact majority tumor cells only kras mutation cells pik3ca mutation minority could due copy number variations kras pik3ca loci
kras/pik3ca ratio mutation frequencies within primary tumors frequency mutations kras pik3ca braf tested correlation degree differentiation prevalence mucin tumor
braf mutations found 26.2% poorly differentiated tumors 8.2% moderate well differentiated
frequencies significantly different chi square test (p value = 0.001)
braf mutations associated mucinous tumors: braf mutations occurred 28% grade 3 mucinous tumors (>50% mucinous tumor cells) but only 9.4% non-mucinous tumors (grade 1 2)
significant chi square test p value = 0.006
similar data been reported previously [ 25 26 ]
kras pik3ca mutations did not correlate either degree differentiation prevalence mucinous cells
lymph node metastases not routinely collected c-07 but pilot study determine feasibility using lymph nodes mutation profiling conducted
we isolated dna 39 lymph nodes containing tumor cells their corresponding primary tumors
primary lymph nodes samples profiled entire oncocarta panel
majority lymph nodes their corresponding primary tumors (89.7%) concordant
total 26 mutations detected lymph nodes including kras braf pik3ca nras 
thirty-five out 39 lymph nodes identical mutation profiles but 4 cases mutations primary tumors not found corresponding lymph nodes ( braf [ 2 ] pik3ca [ 1 ] kras [ 1 ])
peak area evaluation tumors 2 mutations metastatic lymph node available demonstrated differences between primary lymph node samples
table 6 details frequency mutant wt alleles based peak areas 5 such samples
allele frequencies primary tumors two mutations metastatic lymph nodes kras pik3ca ratios demonstrated there more kras mutations pik3ca mutations 4 4 primary samples 3 4 lymph node samples
however notable ratio kras /pik3a lower lymph node compared their primary tumor 3 out 4 samples
sample 0940 kras / pik3ca mutation decreased almost 1/2 lymph node tumor compared primary
thus samples there either loss kras mutations accumulation pik3ca mutations suggesting pik3ca mutations may impart selective advantage lymph node
contrast two other samples less frequent occurrence their pik3ca mutation lymph node primary tumor
sample 2244 pik3ca mutation undetectable lymph node (table 6 )
fact there selection both mutations lymph node then pik3ca mutation frequency would been same kras mutation (0.15)
other hand pik3ca / kras ratio same primary lymph node tumor then pik3ca mutation frequency would been .08 still detectable technology (fig

thus sample 2244 there fewer pik3ca mutant alleles lymph node primary tumor
sample 1837 mutations both braf pik3ca detected braf / pik3ca ratio 1.67 but increased 4.4 metastatic lymph node
sequenom platform provides superior technology screening many hot spot mutations cancer samples
sanger sequencing would require amplification least 60 different fragments per sample many reactions would require optimization thus adding considerable time expense
multiplexing use oncocarta panel allowed us skip time consuming step
thus conservatively sanger sequencing would 40 times more expensive require least 2 times more dna
other sequencing technologies employ differential melting mutant wt sequences such hrma still require pcr product sequenced
would add significant cost time procedure because 60% colon samples contained one more mutations
addition sequenom platform more sensitive sanger sequencing able detect mutations represented only 5% dna
pyrosequencing represented potential alternative sequenom platform but our hands assays needed optimized lack multiplexing made procedure more time consuming demanded more dna
sequenom methodology focuses only those nucleotides known cancer mutations thus makes review sequence information considerably faster sanger
next-generation sequencing cost prohibitive not been shown work dnas isolated ffpet
thus sequenom platform oncocarta panel provided simplest most rapid sensitive cost-effective method detecting hot spot cancer mutations degraded dnas isolated archival routinely processed ffpet
colocarta panel provides more specific panel colon cancer mutation detection greatly reduces amount dna needed mutation profiling
frequencies specific amino acid mutations detected here similar cosmic database other publications [ 6 ]
small variation frequency between our data other reports may attributed differences stage samples analyzed number samples considered sensitivity technology [ 18 ]
observations combined perfect match we obtained between expected detected mutations our control cell lines both fresh ffpe fact mutations detected oncocarta colocarta identical suggest technology reliable reproducible dnas isolated ffpe samples
our study majority tumors (60.3%) one more mutations kras pik3ca braf 
mutations genes likely perturb many different overlapping signaling pathways including pi3k/akt erk/mapk sapk/jnk nfk? others
we able detect other less frequent mutations likely perturb same pathways may cause resistance egfr-targeted therapies reported kras pik3ca braf 
example akt1 nras molecules downstream mediators egfr signaling pathway mutations genes likely affect response drugs target egfr
mutations abl akt1 met detected here but not listed cosmic probably due small number samples analyzed
akt1 -e17k mutation initially identified snp rs34409589 but recent publication found somatic mutation found 3 51 colon cancers [ 27 ]
frequency mutations small study (51 samples) 6% much greater c0-7 samples (0.4%)
difference frequencies may because carpten et al [ 27 ] samples more advanced stages those c-07 trial
moreover selected large tumors (>100 mg) containing more 60% tumor cells
no such selection done our study samples stages ii iii exclusively
significance abl1 akt1 mutations patient prediction prognosis our study questionable given found only one sample represented only 0.4% cases
our knowledge first report met mutations primary colon cancer but different met mutation (n1118y) found lung metastasis large intestine [ 28 ]
met mutations r970c t992i detected 8 out 239 c-07 colon cancers
mutations correspond met -r988c met -t1010i respectively long form met isoform referred cosmic database [ 29 ]
r970c t992i mutations located juxtamembrane segment protein detected lung carcinoma [ 30 ]
mutations when introduced lung cell line increased focus formation formation colonies soft agar cell motility migration
mutations resulted constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation several cellular proteins including paxillin key tyrosine residues may account increased motility cells mutation
another critical amino acid location ser 985 when phosphorylated been found diminish met signaling [ 31 ]
phosphorylation thr residue 992 (1010) reduces signaling then r992i mutation would inhibit negative feedback may result constitutive signaling [ 30 ]
met mutations confer alternative activated signaling pathway then mutations could confer resistance anti-egfr-based therapies provide new target directed therapies
therapeutic drugs been developed specifically target met including small molecule kinase inhibitors anti- met monoclonal antibodies inhibitors hgf met ligand
invitro assays demonstrated number met targeted therapies able prevent met signaling decrease cell viability limit cell motility migration vitro [ 32 ]
small molecule arq 197 kinase inhibitor entered phase ii clinical trials so may represent possible therapeutic strategy some colon tumors
our knowledge one most exhaustive analyses mutation profiling metastatic lymph nodes their corresponding primary colon tumors
our analysis showed majority samples concordant (89.7%) but few samples mutations detected only primary tumor not metastatic lymph node
samples 2 co-occurring mutations ratio double mutations varied primary lymph node tumors
discordance genetic profile between primary tumors metastatic lymph nodes been observed [ 33 ]
such data may indicate tumor cell migration selects different cell populations one primary tumor
however possible mutational differences between lymph node primary tumor result tumor heterogeneity
another interesting observation our study braf mutations significantly correlated poorly differentiated tumors prevalence mucin similar observations been reported [ 25 26 ]
characteristics both associated worse prognosis consistent other reports associating braf mutations bad prognosis [ 3 ]
however our study we found there 2 metastatic lymph nodes did not maintain braf mutation present corresponding primary tumor suggesting braf mutations not essential metastatic spread lymph node all tumors
clearly additional studies would required understand apparent inconsistencies additional lymph node samples not currently available but could subject further studies when samples become available [ 3 ]

note added proof: although met-r988c met-t1010i mutations listed cosmic somatic cancer mutations nucleotide changes correspond snps rs34589476 rs56391007 ncbi snp data base respectively
