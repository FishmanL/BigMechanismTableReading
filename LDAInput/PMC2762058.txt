integration data multiple genome-wide assays essential understanding dynamic spatio-temporal interactions within cells
such integration leads more complete view cellular processes offers opportunity rationalize better high amount "omics" data freely available several public databases
particular integration microarray-derived transcriptome data other high-throughput analyses (genomic mutational analysis promoter analysis) may allow us unravel transcriptional regulatory networks under variety physio-pathological situations such alteration cross-talk between signal transduction pathways transformed cells
here we sequentially apply web-based statistical tools case study: role oncogenic activation different signal transduction pathways transcriptional regulation genes encoding proteins involved camp-pka pathway
end we first re-analyzed available genome-wide expression data genes encoding proteins downstream branch pka pathway normal tissues human tumor cell lines
then order identify mutation-dependent transcriptional signatures we classified cancer cells function their mutational state
results such procedure used starting point analyze structure pka pathway-encoding genes promoters leading identification specific combinations transcription factor binding sites neatly consistent available experimental data help clarify relation between gene expression transcriptional factors oncogenes our case study
genome-wide large-scale "omics" experimental technologies give different complementary perspectives structure regulatory properties complex systems
even relatively simple integrated workflow presented here offers opportunities not only filtering data noise intrinsic high throughput data but progressively extract novel information would remained hidden otherwise
fact we been able detect strong transcriptional repression genes encoding proteins camp/pka pathway cancer cells different genetic origins
basic workflow presented herein may easily extended incorporating other tools applied even researchers poor bioinformatics skills
integration achieves one most important imperatives systems biology namely reduces dimensionality global data needed deliver useful information about networks active system interest
integration data different sources provides effective means deal issue reinforcing bona fide observations reducing false negatives
moreover because different experimental technologies provide different insights system integration multiple data types offers greatest information about particular cellular process [ 1 - 3 ]
example gene perturbation experiments (e.g knockouts rna interference) microarrays analysis reveal relationships between genes may imply direct physical interactions indirect logical interactions
indeed microarray experiments permit us look overall patterns gene expression order understand architecture genetic regulatory networks global approach could ultimately lead complete description transcription-control mechanisms cell
contrast chromatin immunoprecipitation (chip) data reveal direct protein-dna interactions cofactor associations bound transcription factors
combined together technologies provide much more detailed view transcriptional regulatory network either alone
several recent methods addressed problem heterogeneous data integration network prediction modeling noise inherent high-throughput genomic datasets especially using statistical methods significantly improve specificity sensitivity allow robust integration datasets heterogeneous properties [ 4 5 ]
however many methods recently developed implement our ability integrate compare heterogeneous data often not easy use and/or not freely accessible [ 6 7 ]
taking consideration development efficient methods facilitate biological interpretation data crucial present work we focus efficient identification regulatory mechanisms propose approach analysis interpretation gene expression data based integration various types related biological information
camp-pka signalling pathway important regulator cell fate controls activity metabolic enzymes transcription factors cytoskeletal proteins strongly associated onset several endocrine non-endocrine tumors
fundamental characteristic camp its ability stimulate cell proliferation many cell types while inhibiting others
such ability been related fact camp regulates ras/raf/erk pathway whose role cancer onset well known (about 25% human cancers ras mutation)
indeed camp pathway able suppress erk signaling through its ability target c-raf conversely activate erk signaling through its ability target b-raf [ 8 ]
underlying inhibitory mechanism reasonably well characterized involves uncoupling ras signaling c-raf
other hand models explain erk activation camp incomplete addition b-raf involvement other proteins been suggested [ 9 10 ]
many observations regarding camp ability inhibit/stimulate proliferation interfering erks been collected normal immortalized cell lines
however recognizing important role both pathways development cancer relevant more specific analysis their crosstalk network cancer cells [ 11 - 14 ]
previously described ras pathway able crosstalk camp-pka pathway some typical signal transduction mechanisms (i.e
protein-protein interaction protein phosphorylation)
moreover through its ability regulate activity large number transcription factors [ 15 16 ] ras pathway able control several transcriptional programs leading proliferation differentiation metabolism cytoskeletal reorganization immune response
such transcriptional programs result ras-specific effectors stimulation [ 13 17 ]
until now more ten distinct functional classes proteins been involved effectors small gtpase ras but best studied raf kinases type i phosphoinositide (pi) 3-kinases ral-guanine nucleotide exchange factors (ral-gefs) rac exchange factor tiam1 phospholipase c [ 18 ]
raf phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3k) first two identified ras effectors main focus research investigating ras functions [ 19 20 ]
raf promotes cell proliferation differentiation through map kinase (mapk) pathway [ 21 ] same time pi3k generates anti-apoptotic signalling directly through akt pathway activation [ 22 23 ]
both signalling pathways activate two different signals distinct their response timing
indeed both mapk pi3k able activate phosphorylation cascades lead primary effect post-translational modification several substrates (membrane targets cytosolic targets cytoskeletal targets nuclear targets) rapidly activate functional processes
early response ras signalling quite fast: instance resting cells stimulated mitogens ras-gtp level increases within 2 minutes stimulation serum [ 19 ]
raf-1 undergoes transient activation within 2-3 minutes rapidly activates mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) cascade whose most downstream component erk rapidly moves nucleus
here phosphorylates nuclear proteins notably transcription factors [ 24 25 ] whose activity controlled regulating their sub-cellular localization expression stability ability bind other components transcriptional complexes dna their ability remodel chromatin structure [ 26 ]
transcription factors under control mapk pathway including members ets family (i.e
ets-1 ets-2 pu-1) mads box family (i.e
mef2a mef2c sp1) zinc finger family (i.e
gata-2 gata-4) bzip family (i.e
fra-1 c-jun junb jund atf-2 c-fos creb) bhlh family (i.e
c-myc mitf) nuclear hormone receptor (i.e
pr gr er) well other transcription factors (i.e smad1 stat1) coregulatory proteins (i.e cbp p300) [ 15 24 25 ]
like erks akt other targets pi3k signalling phosphorylate activate transcription factors [ 27 ]
akt protein control several transcription factors directly indirectly
direct targets forkhead box proteins foxo cell cycle inhibitor miz1 both inhibited upon akt-mediated phosphorylation
akt-dependent regulation p53 nuclear factor b (nfkb) c-myc activator protein 1 (ap1) beta-catenin indirect [ 16 ]
such observation led us re-analyze using generalized workflow data recovery integration available data multiple global assays several databases (genomics transcriptomics promoter analysis literature)
particular we searched information genes encoding proteins downstream branch pka pathway (starting adenylyl cyclase downstream) tumor cell lines (nci60 cells) function mutational activation different pathways (notably ras pi3k pathway) comparison corresponding normal tissues aim define better connection between pathways cancer cells [ 28 ]
gene-expression profiling been applied extensively cancer research
first step identify regulatory mechanisms underlining gene-expression profiles necessary extract filter cross-reference structure information cancer-related data sets [ 29 ]
aim work been identification cancer-specific specific gene expression signatures genes encoding proteins involved camp-pka pathway
particular we wished identify present differences between primary normal tissues cancer cells search correlation pathway mutationally activated any given transformed cell line integrating accurate analysis recovered data several databases application different statistical tests
nci60 cell collection includes cell lines derived colorectal renal ovarian breast prostate lung central nervous system cancers well leukaemias melanomas (table 1 ) most commonly used cancer research drug screening [ 30 31 ]
good correlation between transcriptional profiles cell lines their tumor cancer origin [ 31 32 ] been found 51 out 59 cell lines
nci60 transcriptional profiles available public databases
cancer cell lines nci60 collection sorted tissue origin since stabilized cell lines within nci60 collection represent physiological model study gene profiles cancer cells features strongly similar cancer tissues we reviewed information present public databases about 60 cell lines 21 normal tissues order identify transformation-dependent transcriptional signatures pka pathway-encoding genes (table 2 )
gene expression profiling datasets nci60 cell lines normal tissues analyzed study gene expression profiles retrieved geo database
dataset (60 profiles) made up nci60 cell lines [ 31 ]
dataset b (13 profiles) subset transcriptional profiles diverse array tissues organs cell lines normal human physiological state [ 106 ]
dataset c (4 profiles) encompasses normal human adult samples derived colonoscopic biopsy present database comprising samples patients crohn's disease ulcerative colitis [ 107 ]
dataset d (4 profiles) contains normal control samples present database containing transcriptional profiles peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) obtained juvenile arthritis patients healthy controls [ 108 ]
we identified gathered transcriptional profile 41 genes encoding proteins involved pka pathway (adenylyl cyclases -adcy- phosphodiesterases -pde- a-kinase anchor proteins -akap- camp-dependent transcriptional factors -tf- pka catalytic subunits -prkac- pka regulatory subunits -prkacr- table 3 ) compared expression profiles cancer cell lines those primary normal tissues collected different datasets (table 3 )
identify differences between normal cancer samples we performed anova analysis entire data set
shown figure 1 distributions expression values genes encoding proteins camp/pka pathway statistically different between normal transformed cells (p-value <0.0001) indicating transformed cells pka pathway-related genes differentially expressed compared normal cells
namely box plot indicates overall distribution expression values transformed cells shifted towards lower expression values
dispersion distribution transformed cells much reduced compared observed normal tissues transformation events superimpose negative regulation largely abrogates tissue-specific regulation (i.e major factor responsible dispersion expression normal tissues see next paragraph)
pka related genes identified all datasets shown table 2 used study statistical analysis 41 pka pathway-encoding genes expression normal transformed samples

same data-set then analyzed through unsupervised hierarchical clustering (as implemented genespring platform) organizes genes according similarity dissimilarity expression profile placing cases similar expression profiles together neighbouring columns dendrogram (figure 2 )
six different classes corresponding main arms dendrogram derived clustering according tissue cell lines (classes i iii correspond left main branch dendrogram iv vi right branch) identified
cell line color-coded bottom according its condition (i.e normal blue transformed red) tissue origin
notably classes ii v contain only transformed cells while only one transformed cell line clusters class vi 
most cases clustering effectively separates normal transformed cell lines same histological origin: instance normal transformed cell lines derived kidney cluster class i iii hemopoietic normal transformed cell lines iv ii colon cancer cells class ii while normal colon class iv respectively (table 4 )
class i iv contained cancer lines several histological origin while class ii enriched cancer cells colon blood class iii ovary kidney class v lung respectively (table 4 )
results indicate regulation pka pathway tissue-dependent keeping pleiotropic tissue-specific phenotypes regulated intracellular camp
suggest transformation transcriptionally remodulates pka pathway so most cases expression profiling genes encoding proteins camp-pka pathway quite different cancer cells compared their normal counterparts
interestingly class iv comprises all colon hemopoietic normal samples we observe strong expression few genes (akap9-11 pde4d prkcb prkar2b creb1- colon sample- akap9-11 pde4b pde8a prkcb prkar1a creb1 crem- hemopoietic sample-) compared their transformed counterparts same genes appeared poorly expressed (class ii )
human colon carcinoma cells been reported prkar2b overexpression suppresses neoplastic cell growth [ 33 ] consistently notion abnormal expression isoforms pka regulatory subunits may involved neoplastic transformation
moreover several models hemopoietic malignancies been shown induction camp/pka pathway stimulates leukemia cell differentiation (event associated relapse disease) lymphoma cells apoptosis [ 34 35 ]

previous paragraph we shown different tissue-specific pattern expression pka pathway encoding genes between normal transformed samples does exist
moreover we observed similar pattern common different tissues both normal transformed samples
while normal tissues such finding may justified common histological origin pka pathway regulating common intracellular process (i.e
differentiation metabolism) transformed samples correct regulation pka pathway lost such similar gene regulation suggest transformation mutation-dependent gene regulation
aim we determined mutation status nci-60 panel human cancer cell lines identified pathway such mutations involved correlated mutation status pathway altered transformed cells transcriptional profiling data
60 cell lines sorted according mutational status using information provided catalogue somatic mutations cancer ( ) divided four groups based carried mutation follows (table 5 ): 1) cell lines carrying mutations able interfere ras pathway (i.e mutations genes encoding ras b-raf erbb2 pdgfra referred ras) 29 cell lines 2) cell lines carrying mutations able interfere pi3k-akt pathway (i.e mutations genes encoding pi3kca pten lkb1 referred pi3k) 13 cell lines
3) cell lines carrying no somatic mutations interfering two above pathways (i.e mutations genes encoding cdkn2a p53 referred other mutation) 14 cell lines 4) cell lines presence somatic mutations interfering above pathways not been searched referred not tested) 4 cell lines
nci60 cell lines predicted active pathways mutational analysis 60 cell lines reorganized 4 categories described text basis most representative mutation cell line: cell lines carrying mutations able interfere ras-raf-mapk pathway (i.e mutations genes encoding ras b-raf erbb2 pdgfra referred ras) cell lines carrying mutations able interfere pi3k-akt pathway (i.e mutations genes encoding pi3kca pten lkb1 referred pi3k) cell lines carrying no somatic mutations interfering two above pathways (i.e mutations genes encoding cdkn2a p53 referred other mutation) cell lines presence somatic mutations interfering two above pathways not been searched referred not tested
assess overall data quality visualize relations differences between aforementioned transformed normal samples we applied dimensional reduction through principal component analysis (pca)
three-dimensional pca plot all expression data (accounting 91% variance) shown figure 3a

three series crossed groups described above namely normal ras pi3k other mutation not tested
normal tissues expression 83% genes classified strong value 2-3 fold higher those observed different transformed groups (27-41%)
overall transformed groups expression most pka pathway-encoding genes classified average low exception ras group only one gene scored low
expression pka pathway-encoding genes further classified follows (figure 3c ): genes similar level expression between normal least one transformed group (blue color) genes whose expression level different between normal transformed groups (yellow color) genes similar expression level among different transformed groups (grey color)
such classification allowed us pinpoint genes such adcy2 akap13 whose expression strong only normal group
more interestingly expression few genes such adcy3 akap8 strong only members transformed groups despite overall reduction expression pka pathway-encoding genes observed transformed samples
results further confirmed pair-wise anova analyses (figure 3d ) distribution expression values genes encoding proteins camp/pka pathway found statistically different between normal group transformed cells (p-value between 0.0001 0.0003)
notably difference distribution between ras group pi3k other mutation groups statistically significant unlike difference not tested group

robust association between transcriptional profiles mutations ras pathway observed (indicated ras red color)
two cell lines not tested group interdispersed within ras group indicating two lines most likely responsible lack statistical difference between ras not tested group (see above)
comparison tissue pathway categories indicated within two ras sub-clusters some tissue-specificity conserved
indeed left cluster comprising total 18 cell lines characterized 6 colon cancers 6 leukemias 5 6 mutated ras pathway
similarly right cluster comprising total 19 cell lines characterized 8 melanomas 5 lung cancers 7 8 mutated ras pathway melanoma 4 5 lung cancer
other sub-clusters comprising all remaining cell lines other three groups mutations consequently pathways more dispersed along clustergram

such distinguishable signature particularly noticeable melanoma cells strong expression gene set encoding complete functional pka pathway module (adcy3 pde4b pde4d pde8a akap12 prkar1a prkar2b prkacb crem) observed suggesting deregulated camp signaling
moreover analysis expression values prkar1a prkar2b genes indicated presence melanoma cells high r1/r2 ratio been associated melanocyte proliferation [ 36 ]

other interesting features indicated analysis include identification binding sites pax6 (indicated red p) zf5f nkxh (indicated red z n respectively) only consensus promoters some genes within normal transformed group respectively
another feature may critical identification enriched elements number copies given tfbs within promoter
fact been documented presence multiple copies cis -elements promoters particularly when clustered makes transcriptional activation stronger [ 31 32 ]
reason total number frequency (number tfbs/promoter) 30 tfbss previously identified scored within 15 subgroups classified hierarchical clustering (figure 6a 6b respectively)

using generalized workflow data recovery integration combines accurate analysis recovered data several databases application different statistical tests we been able correlate strong transcriptional repression genes encoding proteins camp/pka pathway transformed samples different genetic origin (i.e bearing mutations different pathways)
finding prompted us compute consensus promoters whose composition specifically enriched different transcription factor binding sites (tbfs)
comparison tfbs computationally identified consensus promoters tbfs experimentally identified variety techniques shows good agreement
indeed lowering stringency used workflow some tfbs missed higher stringency analysis (false negatives) recovered keeping notion intersection different data sets and/or techniques decreases both noise number hits
workflow we followed summarized figure 7 detailed methods section
number sites hosting curated transcriptional profiles increases more more data used starting point become available
we used geo database recover data nci60 cell collection (cancer samples) matching normal tissues specific statistical tests (i.e
anova hierarchical clustering) applied
using cosmic database gives information about mutational status nci60 collection we could sort nci60 cell lines 4 subgroups mutational activation genes encoding components ras pathway pi3k pathway other pathways no information available
such sorting allowed us uncover hitherto unrecognized oncogene-dependent pattern regulation 41 genes encoding components camp/pka pathway (figure 7b 7c )

observation some extent expected because limited literature reference availability complexity retrieve data difficulty analyze data several origins lack powerful data analysis integration tools
under less-than-ideal conditions dedicated tool such tfbs database extremely powerful allowing predictions amenable experimental verification should necessary
discussed above most false-negatives failed detected our computational approaches could recovered appropriately lowering stringency analysis

general balanced co-regulation both positive negative regulators camp/pka pathway apparent both normal transformed samples

should remembered cross-talk between pka pathway oncogene-mediated pathways take place post-transcriptional levels
example several authors reported ability oncogenic viral ras proteins either stimulate [ 89 - 91 ] inhibit [ 92 - 94 ] adcy activity different cell lines (thyroid epithelial kidney fibroblast)
moreover involvement mapk pi3k pathways regulation pde activity been reported suggesting mitogenic stimulation may positively regulate pde4 expression directly [ 95 ] confirming our transcriptional results post-translational mechanisms p42(mapk) phosphorylation activity relevant role their regulation [ 96 ]
another important post-transcriptional mechanism links ras pi3k pathways camp/pka pathway positive negative control creb activity phosphorylation [ 97 98 ]
moreover been reported camp able induce proliferation rather growth inhibition several tumors where oncogenic activation b-raf been identified (i.e melanoma thyroid cancer) [ 8 ]
nevertheless general coordinated down-regulation essentially all genes pathway transformed cells (as compared normal tissues) suggests least one pka-mediated function needs reduced substantially order express transformed phenotype
although stage too early propose specific hypotheses intriguing remember pka been ascribed role activating mitochondrial respiration decreasing ros production [ 99 100 ] thus effectively counteracting mitochondria dysfunction found associated increased glycolysis (warburg effect [ 101 - 103 ]) many cancer cells
other hand reduction oxidative phosphorylation will decrease atp supply substrate adenylate cyclase may result decreased camp production without relevant changes level enzymes (and possibly therefore their gene expression)
expected deeper computational integration transcriptional data other genome-wide findings including -but not limited to- proteomics interactomics metabolomics will allow better extraction hidden information
we propose such data integration further applied examine topology biological networks provide information directionality interactions create wiring diagrams better depict functional outcome component-component relationships
together strategies should facilitate systems approach modular biology
thus systems biology approached perturbing suspected components given cellular process monitoring responses integrating data modeling biological process question [ 104 ]
applying single "omic" approach able sample "horizontal" slice (i.e
across all genes gene products) multidimensional space knowledge system expanded single gene network genes regarded basic model system
when genes proteins network systematically disrupted responses other parts network recorded data obtained incorporated basic model
however sampling single dimension complex space will undoubtedly provide relevant information but may not highlight major regulatory features
therefore wiring diagram depicts direction interactions network behavior components constructed better represent relationships between components [ 104 ]
example shown figure 7 illustrates how our current knowledge biological system expanded model built based integrated "omic" information
ultimately development such computational methods their recursive integration genome-wide hypothesis-driven experimental investigations take account post-translational substrate-dependent mechanisms controlling camp/pka pathway activity should reconcile experiments different experimental systems (cell cultures animal models human tumor samples) contribute explain integrative systems level how camp-pka pathway affected oncogenic processes originated mutational activation signal transduction
gene expression data nci60 cell lines normal tissues samples downloaded gene expression omnibus (geo) national center biotechnology information (ncbi) website ( ) [ 105 ]
particular gene expression profiles nci60 cell collection (cancer samples) recovered geo database ( gse5949 [ 31 ]) experimental data obtained using affymetrix hg-u95av2 oligonucleotide array platform
analysis only results obtained oligonucleotide arrays considered because platform uses different method evaluate mrna expression compared cdna array platform
therefore normal tissue samples data used comparative analysis recovered transcriptional profiles produced using u95av2 oligonucleotide array ( gse96 [ 106 ] gse6731 [ 107 ] gse1402 [ 108 ])
total 81 transcriptional profiles encompassing cancer cell lines nine histological origins samples six normal tissues recovered

all datasets generated downloading processing cel files
preprocessed using robust multichip average (rma) [ 109 110 ] then transformed log2 values linear scale values normalized per gene median value its level expression across 81 samples implemented genespring gx 7.3.1 (silicon genetics - )
rma preprocessing algorithm includes background quantile normalization steps [ 109 111 ]
although background correction first step analysis been computed separately array all other procedures performed using rma (normalization summarization) been performed across all arrays (rma multiple-array method)
normalization necessary so multiple chips compared other analyzed together
normalization procedure aimed making distributions identical across arrays
rma usually gives very accurate normalizations
note rma implemented genespring gx 7.3.1 all arrays used no chip discarded
we used rma analysis compared other tools analysis because described several papers [ 112 113 ] successfully reduces variance low abundance transcripts better distinguishes differentially expressed transcripts those unchanging using controlled datasets known quantities specific mrnas been added common reference pool [ 109 110 114 ]
we identified gathered transcriptional profile 41 genes encoding proteins involved pka pathway (adenylyl cyclases -adcy- phosphodiesterases -pde- a-kinase anchor proteins -akap- camp-dependent transcriptional factors -tf- pka catalytic subunits -prkac- pka regulatory subunits -prkacr- table 3 )
