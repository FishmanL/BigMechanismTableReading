serum levels igf-i patients affected multiple myeloma (mm) been scarcely studied
present study aimed explore point comparing 55 healthy subjects 71 monoclonal gammopaties uncertain significance (mgus) 77 overt mm patients
same subjects basic fgf vegf been detected
all three mediators analyzed function k- ras mutation melphalan response
concerning igf-i two representative monitoring examples been added
cytokine determinations performed commercially available elisa kits while k12- ras mutation investigated genomic dna isolated bone marrow cell specimens rflp-pcr assay
significant reductions igf-i levels observed mgus mm compared healthy controls
addition mm subjects showed significantly decreased serum igf-i levels mgus
conversely increasing levels observed bfgf vegf molecules significantly correlated
multivariate analysis corrected age gender confirmed significant difference only igf-i values (p = 0.01)
k12- ras mutation significantly associated malignancy response therapy significantly increased serum bfgf levels
igf-i reduction transition: controls?mgus?mm changes observed over time suggest igf-i should furtherly studied future clinical trials possible monitoring marker mm
spite progresses recently registered therapy multiple myeloma (mm) prognosis patients affected disease remains still poor [ 1 ]
mm demonstrate progressive usually fatal course traditional treatments generally producing only temporary remissions
5-year survival mm patients about 25% less 5% alive subjects after 10 years [ 1 ]
among innovative treatments antiangiogenic therapy seems represent promising approach whose rationale based tumour growth inhibition starving cancer cells vital nutrients [ 2 ]
recent evidences indicate angiogenic processes increased fundamental not only solid tumours but hematologic diseases including mm well [ 3 4 ]
scarce angiogenic activities been found monoclonal gammopathy undetermined significance (mgus) compared overt malignant forms where marrow neoangiogenesis parallels tumour progression correlates poor prognosis suggesting angiogenesis-dependent regulation disease activity [ 5 - 7 ]
neoangiogenesis under control various cytokines expressed neoplastic plasma cells so their involvement mm pathophysiology been strongly supported different reports [ 8 ]
modulators include vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) hepatocyte growth factor (hgf) basic fibroblast growth factor (bfgf) been extensively investigated biological samples derived mm patients
however data concerning their potential prognostic power well their reciprocal interactions still conflicting [ 8 - 10 ] remain better elucidated
vegf major regulator tumour-associated angiogenesis exhibiting various biological activities including regulation embryonic stem cell development local generation inflammatory cytokines [ 11 ]
vegf gene encodes least five isoforms anchored extracellular matrix through heparin-binding domains
mitogenic vascular endothelial cells induce vascular permeabilization [ 11 ]
vegf expression regulated several factors including interleukins (il-1? il-6 il-10) fibroblast growth factor (fgf-4) insulin-like growth factor1(igf-1) [ 12 ]
bfgf 18 24 kd polypeptide mainly produced cells mesenchymal origin shares key role mediator angiogenesis vegf vitro [ 13 ] vivo [ 14 ]
molecule normally bound heparin heparan sulphate proteoglycans extracellular matrix particularly basement membranes around vessels stromal cells
binds family four distinct high affinity tyrosine kinase receptors (fgfr-1?4) stimulates endothelial cell proliferation vitro [ 13 ]
igf-i mitogen anti-apoptotic cytokine/growth factor/hormone produced several types cells (fibroblasts hepatocytes chondroblasts ..) [ 15 ]
its potential role growth factor myeloma cells been deeply analyzed data ge nl et al [ 16 ] suggest igf-i significantly contributes expansion mm cells vivo activation two distinct pathways: akt/bad mapk kinase
moreover been suggested circulating levels igf-i its inhibitory binding proteins (igf-bp 1?6) may associated increasing risk common cancers [ 17 ]
main circulating component igf-i released liver under gh control while locally different regulatory mechanisms been reported [ 18 19 ]
free igf-i (molecules unbound igf-bps) acts through specific high-affinity igf-i receptor but insulin receptor igf-ii receptor may used although lower affinities [ 20 ]
recent data literature seem support idea functional link existing between induction angiogenesis-mediated growth factor expression gene alterations tumour development
particular c-myc deregulation pdgf-bb been demonstrated either normal [ 21 ] tumour cells [ 22 ]
moreover existence relationship between activation ras oncogenes regulation vegf/vpf expression been demonstrated experimental [ 23 ] clinical [ 24 ] studies
regard there several reasons supporting fact ras gene represents interesting case studying impact cancer-associated genetic mutations tumour angiogenesis
fact activated ras capable triggering several crucial signalling cascades so altering expression some members ras -responsive genes many could relevant triggering contributing tumour angiogenesis [ 25 ]
although mechanisms governing expression angiogenic cytokines tumour cell dominantly acting oncogenes largely unknown regulatory effect oncogenes angiogenic mediators some potentially important therapeutic consequences needs better investigated especially hematologic malignancies

report primarily employed univariate analysis data means non parametric tests (mann whitman kruskall wallis variance analysis quantitative corrected x square fisher's exact test categorical data)
besides univariate analysis multivariate logistic regression analysis performed significances adjusted age gender
logistic regression analysis employed end point four variables subdivided two groups subjects exceeding not cut off value (i.e
median value relative controls)
multivariate logistic regression analysis been applied using spss version 6.0 microsoft windows 95/98
model applies stepwise logistic regression ("spss backward lr method")
p < 0.05 cut off been employed significance evaluation
analyze basal characteristics subjects studied report (table 1 ) we tabulated data concerning main clinical features subdivided three groups namely: 55 healthy blood donors 71 mgus 77 mm
no significant variations registered gender three comparisons while age significantly differed when control subjects compared mgus mm
median serum levels ranges three cytokine: igf-i bfgf vegf compared those healthy controls reported table 2 
serum levels igf-i significantly sequentially reduced controls mgus mgus mm
significances between three groups always < 0.0001
addition significances more pronounced those observed bfgf vegf
multivariate logistic regression analysis showed significances observed igf-i concentrations three groups independent age gender relative p 0.01

igf-i behaviour been confirmed logistic regression analysis after data correction age gender described text
bfgf presented significantly different serum values among three groups
particular there statistically significant difference (p = 0.001) between controls mgus patients higher values observed
similar difference registered between controls mm patients (p = 0.02) while contrast mgus mm showed similar results (p = 0.27)
multivariate analysis corrected age gender did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.9)
vegf finally did not show significant variations four comparisons (p least > 0.14) multivariate analysis performed above not significant (p = 0.08)
correlation matrix using values four variables mgus mm groups only resulted significant vegf vs b fgf (r = 0.37 p = 0.002) mgus patients
since known gene alterations may linked cytokine modulation we analyzed incidence (%) k- ras mutations mgus mm subjects due emerging role gene plasma cell dyscrasia pathogenesis [ 29 30 ]
mutations k- ras codon 12 analyzed genomic dna isolated bone marrow cell specimens two groups patients
due presence low-molecular weight fragments isolated dna 66 out total 71 mgus samples 73 out total 77 mm samples considered suitable genetic analyses
k- ras gene mutations present only one (15%) mgus subject twenty (274%) mm ones
expected none control specimens analyzed manifested gene alterations (table 3 )
fact observed highly significant (p < 0.0001) difference between controls mm between mgus mm while no significance found between controls mgus groups (p = 0.95) means two two comparison three groups (controls mgus mm) concerning distribution k- ras gene mutation k- ras gene status response therapy statistical significance k12-ras gene mutation: control vs mgus p = 0.95 control vs mm p = 0.0001 mgus vs mm p < 0.0001 positive therapy response: minor response no change disease (see methods) 
interestingly significant increases (p = 0.02) serum bfgf levels observed patients showing k- ras gene mutation (median = 4.6 pg/ml range = 1.2?19.6 pg/ml) compared those gene wild type form (median = 2.2 pg/ml range = 1.0?20.8 pg/ml)
no statistically significant differences between k- ras gene status serum factor concentrations found igf-i vegf
seventy-three mm patients showing not k- ras gene mutations analyzed their response therapy
shown table 3 presence k- ras mutations significantly associated lower response melphalan compared wild type k- ras subjects (p = 0.015)
statistically not significant trend (p = 0.07) observed serum bfgf concentrations when comparing responders (mean = 1.9 pg/ml range = 1.2?20.8 pg/ml) non responders (mean = 3.8 pg/ml range = 1.3?19.6 pg/ml)
attempt find link between response therapy (yes/not) k- ras gene status (mutant/wild type) cytokine level (greater lower cut-off) we could only confirm strong influence k- ras gene status rather level four different cytokines determining therapy response mm patients (data not shown)
several patients followed up during therapy
figure 1 shows two them presenting least six/seven observation times consecutive serum samples time diagnosis until death analyzed
first patient (panel a) high serum igf-i (165 ng/ml) level diagnosis
he showed minor response treatment least 15 months 26% fall serum m-protein concentration concomitant slight reduction igf-i amounts
then new cycles therapy administered because tumour progression
patient responded treatment about 10 months (s-m protein = 6 g/l serum igf-i level = 101 ng/ml) then relapsed again
new treatment then initiated but patient died after about 5 months
second patient (panel b) normal serum igf-i (51 ng/ml) concentration diagnosis did not respond treatment exception igf-i reduction observed 10 months after starting therapy he showed only slight modifications both serum variables during course disease
mm evolution been shown strongly conditioned angiogenic mechanisms terms growth therapy sensitivity
several authors tried explain how angiogenic cytokines [ 4 31 ] may work influencing mm cells consequently recent years presence quantity several angiogenic factors their inducers their signalling mediators been documented effort explore possibility use them diagnostic monitoring prognostic markers disease evolution therapy sensitivity
despite bulk information clear indications not been completely gained some different contrasting results been published [ 4 8 9 32 - 34 ]
general angiogenic mediators (vegf basic fgf tgf-beta1 tnf-alpha) been found increased mm patients often significantly correlated others [ 8 ]
sometimes stage related although not all reports consistent field
angiogenic factors show different behaviours under treatment
interestingly while conventional therapy (melphalan plus prednisolone) reduced serum concentrations factors [ 35 ] anti-angiogenic therapy based thalidomide plus dexamethasone accompanied increase same factors responder subjects [ 4 34 ]
another molecule involved mm biology igf-i mediator cytokine (locally)/hormone (in general circulation) activity [ 36 ] known growth promoter several tumours including mm acting through its anti-apoptotic/proliferative [ 16 19 37 ] effects interaction angiogenic factors such anti-proliferative tgf-beta1 [ 38 ]
surprisingly serum data regarding igf-i mm very scarce partially contrasting [ 39 40 ] although igf-i suspected able transform mgus mm [ 41 ]
previous data b-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia found clear reduction igf-i sera compared controls [ 42 ] even though studies initially expected exibit increased concentrations due tumourigenic activity igf-i
not so surprising igf-i determinations obtained sera subjects already affected mm
known all cancers including mm possess more less strong inflammatory component (in particular proinflammatory cytokines il-6 tnf-alpha produced myeloma cells) inflammation associated reduced igf-i synthesis [ 43 ]
data literature showed igf-i molecules may modulated socs genes after their activation proinflammatory cytokines [ 37 ]
present study clearly shows serum igf-i concentrations significantly decreased healthy blood donors mgus mm patients finding not previously described
result independent age (significantly lower controls) sex confirmed multivariate regression analysis both all subjects when only igg mm patients considered (data not shown)
similar analysis obtained separately male female patients confirmed our findings (data not shown) indicating gender not cause differences previously described
findings open possibility igf-i molecule might further studied monitoring marker follow patients over time specific trials
previous study standal coworkers [ 39 ] failed observe significant differences between mm controls
such divergence may depend some patient characteristics
example standal selected only patients 69% advanced tumour stages (iii) while our patients prevalently tumour stages i ii
previously mentioned chronic b cell leukaemia showed data similar those reported our paper [ 42 ]
opposite igf-i behaviour vegf bfgf whose concentrations increased mm sera compared control samples
vegf b-fgf serum concentrations highly correlated (p = 0.002) confirming results previously published other authors [ 8 ]
another variable considered study k- ras gene whose mutation significantly associated malignancy [ 29 30 ] while no significant difference observed between controls mgus
k- ras gene alteration previously been associated modulation different biological agents including igf-i [ 23 24 44 45 ]
reported solid tumours [ 47 ] we found significant increases serum bfgf concentrations mm patients eliciting k- ras gene activation
moreover same k12- ras mutation significantly associated increased resistance therapy (table 3 )
trend lower serum bfgf levels observed when responders mm patients compared non responder ones
when k12- ras mutation levels 3 cytokines under above cut offs combined no significant differences found different subgroups (data not shown)
therefore therapy effect only dependent k- ras mutation not cytokine levels
considering results present study we tried evaluate possibility igf-i might used monitoring marker
therefore we show two representative examples mm patients followed during subsequent courses therapy whose disease behaviour related monoclonal component concentrate serum igf-i levels over time
results show generally serum igf-i concentrations behave similarly monoclonal component
some divergences observed may explained fact various eveniences may influence serum igf-i levels: age gender [ 47 ] inflammatory processes [ 48 ] other concomitant diseases [ 49 50 ] endocrine diseases [ 47 ] nutrition [ 47 ] drug administration liver toxicity
furthermore melphalan therapy hepatotoxic therefore should reduce igf-i synthesis been reported increase igf-i molecules after 4th course [ 40 ] possibly when effective restoring peripheral blood igf-i amounts
possible speculate cytotoxic effect therapy should release great amount endocellular molecules necrotic cells induction inflammatory processes igf-i drop
conclusion previously reported other neoplastic diseases [ 42 51 ] serum igf-i concentrations clearly reduced case open disease
therefore clinical use serum determinations molecule should made very carefully since substance does not show clear specificity mm
possible role igf-i putative monitoring marker malignant disease seems emerge our study even though specific clinical trials need planned possible interference other factors serum determinations should considered
all contributing authors declare no actual potential conflicts interest do exist
