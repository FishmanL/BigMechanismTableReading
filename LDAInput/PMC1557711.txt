r115777 promising treatment breast cancer but relation between effect growth factor receptor ras status established
ras pathway activity critical tumour growth [ 1 ]
breast cancers activity ras signalling pathway appears increased chiefly via activation wild-type ras proteins upstream growth factor receptors such epidermal growth factor receptor c-erbb-2 (her2) [ 2 3 ]
expression receptors increased 30?40% all breast cancers [ 4 ] furthermore over-expression indicative more aggressive phenotype [ 5 6 ]
point mutations ras genes result over-activated ras proteins
incidence ras mutations human tumours overall about 30% whereas incidence activating ras mutations breast cancers low only few percent [ 7 - 9 ]
ras pathway activated variety extracellullar factors [ 10 ] aberrant function ras signal transduction pathway thought common breast cancer [ 2 ]
preclinical data suggested ras inhibition inhibitory effect growth cell lines express both mutated wild-type ras [ 11 - 13 ]
ras proteins play important role signal transduction cellular transformation [ 14 ]
function signal transduction activation downstream pathways ras must attach plasma membrane where interact membrane receptors downstream effectors such raf phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3k)
activation raf-mapk (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway stimulates proliferation cell activation pi3k-pkb (protein kinase b)/akt pathway related increased cell survival [ 15 ]
ras synthesized pro-peptide (pro-ras)
one way target ras activity inhibit enzyme farnesyl transferase catalyzes major step modification pro-ras
farnesylation makes ras protein more hydrophobic therefore becomes possible protein attach plasma membrane [ 10 ]
several different farnesyl transferase inhibitors (ftis) been developed

we shown effect growth related reduced cti cancer cell lines tumours vivo cti statistically significantly reduced human dcis treated fti after 1 week
effect cti due both antiproliferative pro-apoptotic effect
study effect fti we conducted series experiments: first vitro studies different human cancer cell lines second vivo studies tumour growth inhibition selected cell lines finally studies human dcis implanted directly operating theatre nude mice model earlier used our department
ras pathway activated variety extracellullar factors aberrant function ras signal transduction not only due ras mutations
we could not assess activation ras signalling pathway but chose study downstream effects fti measured change apoptosis proliferation
we tried relate effect fti growth factor receptor status ras status
furthermore showing unfarnesylated protein treated cell pellets cell line tumours we demonstrated effect farnesylation fti r115777
strikingly we found effect proliferation apoptosis consistent in vivo studies cell tumours expressing wild-type ras (mcf-7/her2-18 skov3) human dcis
results growth inhibition vitro accordance vivo results (for instance largest effect tumour growth vivo seen cell line lowest ic50 vitro )
no antiproliferative effect no pro-apoptotic effect seen k-ras mutated mda-mb231 tumours treated fti no tumour growth inhibition resulting treatment observed cell line
mda-mb231 cell line highest ic50
other ftis been shown inhibit both mutated wild-type ras [ 30 31 ] but relative resistance ftis k-ras mutated cell lines been reported [ 32 33 ]
although we unable establish ras status dcis lesions our human dcis xenograft experiments majority (70%) her2 positive would expected activated wild-type ras
we found no areas invasive breast cancer our day 0 xenografts
however some mixture invasive cancer cells occurred xenografts then should been evenly distributed between controls treated animals therefore causing no bias
cell lines considered our vitro experiments selected represent different expressions growth factor receptor ers
we unable detect clear relationship between any factors effect fti
example ic50s mcf-7 mcf-7/her2-18 not significantly different in vitro experiments
mcf-7/her2-18 mcf-7 cell line 45-fold over-expression her2 receptor caused transfection full-length her2 cdna [ 34 ]
however experiment similar ours cell line tumour growth inhibition studied same fti used kelland coworkers [ 12 ] identified inhibition about 60?70% treated mcf-7 cell line tumours
less inhibition approximately 80% we found mcf-7/her2-18 tumours using same dose r115777
might indication her2 expression plays role response farnesyl transferase vivo 
effect her2 transfected mcf-7 cell line tumours considerably more pronounced effect skov3 cell tumours reflected 10-fold lower ic50
other studies [ 11 13 ] unable show clear relation between markers such growth factor receptors ras status effect ftis
work kelland colleagues we found no dose respond effect chosen doses namely 50 100 mg/kg
mechanism might threshold effect due saturable drug pharmacokinetics [ 12 ]
we did not study effect fti subgroups dcis (for example er positive/negative her2 positive/negative)
we stratified treatment dose r115777 but not possible compare results between two different doses because number xenografts too small after stratification
however all results proliferation apoptotic change different groups pointed same direction except unchanged apoptotic index after seven days treatment lower dose group
clinical studies r115777 phase i trials shown reversible myelosuppression dose-limiting toxicity drug [ 35 36 ]
phase ii study continuous intermittent dosing r15777 women advanced breast cancer [ 37 ] partial response stable disease demonstrated about 20% treated women
forty-one primary tumours study conducted johnston coworkers [ 37 ] analyzed ras mutations only one tumour h-ras mutation
no correlation between response er and/or her2 expression seen study
no clinical studies involving ftis patients dcis been performed knowledge ras status dcis lesions sparse
one study [ 38 ] two out 25 dcis lesions over-expressed wild-type k-ras another study [ 39 ] four out five dcis patients expressed detectable plasma levels wild-type ras but no ras mutations found studies
we shown fti effective some tumours not others
future might possible identify those tumours will benefit treatment fti
series new signal transduction inhibitors (stis) under development [ 40 ]
gaining better understanding how different interactions normal upregulated downregulated signal pathways work we hopefully will able tailor breast cancer treatment individual patients
furthermore data suggest combining stis endocrine therapy may more effective sti alone [ 41 - 43 ]
there lack correlation between preclinical results ftis results clinical studies
inhibition farnesylation not been clearly correlated tumour inhibition cancer patients [ 44 ]
there need identify targets ftis preclinical setting we understand clinical results able select patients future studies
breast cancer potentially suitable tumour type study because possible perform experiments similar ours human tumours tested xenograft model
exact mechanism action ftis cancer cells remains unknown
other ras-independent mechanisms action might play role antitumour effect including inhibition enzymes other farnesyl transferases [ 44 45 ]
we clearly demonstrated inhibition farnesylation vitro present study
we demonstrated effect farnesylation cell tumours good response r115777 treatment
however effect not clear in vitro setting varied among treated tumours
indicates mechanisms other farnesyl transferase inhibition involved tumour growth inhibition
treatment fti reduced cell growth vitro 
cell tumour growth vivo reduced we showed increased apoptosis decreased proliferation resulting reduced cti
human dcis xenografts treatment resulted reduced cti
fti r115777 promising new treatment breast cancer
