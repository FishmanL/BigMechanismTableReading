immunostained section examined under light microscope evaluated nuclear staining ( figure 1a ) twice senior pathologist (mt) who did not any knowledge clinical molecular analysis those samples
present there no validated criteria evaluating immunohistochemical staining p-mapk therefore we used grading system evaluating p-mapk staining based staining distribution
dysplastic normal mucosa glands divided three equal areas (upper middle lower)
p-mapk-positive cells classified three types ( figure 1 ): type localised within upper area only type b localised upper middle type c localised upper through lower
we analysed immunostaining p-mapk separately tumour adjacent normal tissue
unfortunately two paired pns adjacent normal mucosa five samples adjacent normal mucosa not informative p-mapk immunostaining because small amounts tissue blocks

difference statistically significant ( p =0.0022 ? 2 test)
however about 80% adjacent normal mucosa showed type p-mapk expression
there no significant difference incidence type p-mapk expression adjacent normal mucosa between fdns pns (34 out 46 42 out 50 respectively p =0.2241 ? 2 test)
we compared clinicopathological molecular characteristics between neoplasia type type b/c immunostaining p-mapk ( table 3 )
fdns type b/c expression p-mapk observed significantly more frequently duke's carcinomas adenomas ( p= 0.0338 fisher's exact test)
we observed no significant difference incidence type b/c immunostaining p-mapk between fdns without braf mutations
contrast type b/c immunostaining p-mapk detected more frequently large (?10?mm) small (<10?mm) pns
size-related difference statistically significant ( p= 0.0265 fisher's exact test)
type b/c immunostaining p-mapk demonstrated more frequently pns kras mutations without kras mutations ( p= 0.0272 fisher's exact test)
braf status been examined variety human malignancies
braf mutations been reported approximately 10% crcs ( davies et al 2002 rajagopalan et al 2002 fransen et al 2004 )
however status braf gene precursor lesions crcs not been thoroughly explored there morphological heterogeneity oncogenesis ( shimoda et al 1989 )
flat-depressed protruding adenomas may precursors cancers arising de novo polypoid cancers respectively
our knowledge first study mutational status braf terms morphological characteristics colorectal nonserrated neoplasias
protruding neoplasias significantly higher frequency kras mutation flat neoplasias despite similarity tumour size ( fujimori et al 1994 minamoto et al 1994a yamagata et al 1994 yashiro et al 2001 )
we identified four fdns (9%) mutations braf but no pns mutations
contrast kras mutations observed none fdns 25% pns
braf kras mutations mutually exclusive morphologically distinct nonserrated neoplasias (fdns pns respectively)
mutational spots braf gene cluster within activation segment (exon 15) g-loop (exon 11) kinase domain highly conserved among serine/threonine kinases throughout evolution
our series all mutations exon 15 braf observed depressed neoplasias (dns) involved conversion valine glutamic acid codon 599 (v599e)
v599e mutation ?hot spot' mutation colorectal cancers well other human cancers ( davies et al 2002 rajagopalan et al 2002 wang et al 2003 yuen et al 2003 domingo et al 2004 fransen et al 2004 koinuma et al 2004 )
although we need more extensive analysis v599e mutations might contribute tumorigenesis dns
other non-v559 mutations detected here novel mutations p452t (exon 11) t588i (exon 15) crcs
t588i mutation may associated increased mapk activity because tumour mutation showed type b c expression p-mapk protein
continuous activation mapk signalling pathway critical importance development crcs
p-mapk forms (phosphorylated erk1 erk2) translocate nucleus modulate gene expression through activation transcriptional factors ( peyssonnaux eychene 2001 )
nuclear staining observed here positive reaction p-mapk protein type b c immunostaining p-mapk frequently observed fdns pns
incidence type b c immunostaining p-mapk significantly higher fdns pns
thus abnormal accumulation p-mapk protein more likely associated tumorigenesis fdns pns
mutational activation braf kras gene signals act through classical mapk cascade promote proliferation ( davies et al 2002 )
we found type b/c expression p-mapk more frequently observed pns kras mutation
therefore mutational type kras might activate mapk pathway more strongly wild-type kras ( vojtek der 1998 )
type b/c immunostaining p-mapk observed more frequently large pns small pns
kras gene mutation frequency colorectal polyps increases proportion their size ( vogelstein et al 1988 )
14 pns kras mutations series 11 (79%) adenomas
thus derangement mapk signalling pathway may early size-dependent event tumorigenesis pns correlates status kras mutation
other hands there no significant difference incidence type b/c immunostaining p-mapk between fdns without braf mutations
type b/c immunostaining p-mapk more common duke's carcinomas adenomas fdns
implies abnormal accumulation p-mapk protein may critical event tumour progression fdns independently braf mutations
our immunohistochemical data suggest alterations mapk pathway important development fdns but may highlight new therapeutic strategies dealing crcs arise fdns
more 70% fdns show positive immunostaining p-mapk signalling pathway may play important role tumorigenesis fdns
many reported crcs arising fdns nonpolypoid neoplasias ( shimoda et al 1989 bedenne et al 1992 iishi et al 1992 kudo 1993 minamoto et al 1994b konishi et al 1999 rembacken et al 2000 kaneko et al 2004 )
therefore inhibition either p-mapk related molecule might new therapeutic strategy treat crcs
ci-1040 (pd184352) highly selective inhibitor mapk signalling cascade specifically targeting inhibition mek ( delaney et al 2002 )
antitumour activity found correlate ci-1040-mediated inhibition phosphorylated erk levels
however braf mutations infrequent fdns
moreover no significant mutations araf raf-1 been found crcs ( fransen et al 2004 )
however raf-mek-erk pathway regulated via interaction modulation function wide range signalling proteins ( english et al 1999 zimmermann moelling 1999 kolch 2000 )
therefore further investigation required clarify what leads tumour-specific expression p-mapk fdns
we found msi-h seven 44 fdns (16%) but only one 52 pns (2%)
seven fdns msi-h four adenomas three duke's carcinomas
olschwang et al (1998) reported eight out 36 flat colorectal neoplasias showed msi-h (22%)
frequency msi-h series did not differ regard histological type
however yashiro et al (2001) observed no significant difference incidence msi-h between flat-type polypoid-type cancers (four out 25 zero out 25 respectively)
selection tumour samples may explain difference
our series 41% fdns showed depressed type morphology about two-thirds fdns 10?mm more diameter
however suggested some flat neoplasias may progress de novo cancers loh chromosome 3p location hmlh1 could explain onset msi-h alternative mechanism hypermethylation promoter hmlh1 
previous studies ( rajagopalan et al 2002 wang et al 2003 domingo et al 2004 koinuma et al 2004 ) reported braf mutations occur more frequently microsatellite-unstable microsatellite-stable crcs
however we observed no significant difference incidence braf mutations between fdns without msi-h
summary braf kras mutations mutually exclusive morphological characteristics colorectal nonserrated neoplasias
high-frequency microsatellite instability significantly more frequently seen fdns pns
therefore possible some fdns braf mutation msi-h progress de novo type cancers (ie flat depressed cancers without accompanying adenoma)
abnormal accumulation p-mapk protein seems more frequently implicated tumorigenesis fdns pns
however accumulation significantly correlated incidence kras mutations pns but not braf mutations fdns
derangement mapk pathway fdns might occur via genetic alteration other braf kras mutation.
