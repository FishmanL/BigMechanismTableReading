chemotherapy biological agents combinations both little impact survival patients metastatic melanoma
advances understanding genetic changes associated development melanoma resulted availability promising new agents inhibit specific proteins up-regulated signal cell pathways inhibit anti-apoptotic proteins
sorafenib multikinase inhibitor raf/ras/mek pathway elesclomol (sta-4783) oblimersen (g3139) antisense oligonucleotide targeting anti-apoptotic bcl-2 phase iii clinical studies combination chemotherapy
agents targeting mutant b-raf (raf265 plx4032) mek (pd0325901 azd6244) heat-shock protein 90 (tanespimycin) mtor (everolimus deforolimus temsirolimus) vegfr (axitinib) showed some promise earlier stages clinical development
receptor tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (imatinib dasatinib sunitinib) may role treatment patients melanoma harbouring c-kit mutations
although often studied single agents disappointing results new targeted drugs should more thoroughly evaluated combination therapies
future rational use new targeted agents depends successful application analytical techniques enabling molecular profiling patients leading selection likely therapy responders
treatment melanoma once metastasised beyond locoregional sites remains unsatisfactory
range different treatments based chemotherapy biological agents combination both (reviewed elsewhere) little impact survival [ 1 ? 3 ]
single-agent chemotherapy produces responses 10?20% patients advanced melanoma although there no evidence translates survival advantage
complete responses occur ?2% cases median survival associated chemotherapy 9 months 13% patients alive 2 years [ 4 ]
commonly used compounds include dacarbazine (dtic) temozolomide fotemustine cisplatin carboplatin vinblastine paclitaxel docetaxel [ 5 ]
single agent dtic been most commonly used even when not been formally compared other agents observation alone
usual dose 1000 mg/m2 every 3?4 weeks (given either 1 day five daily doses 200 mg/m2)
some centres substitute dtic temozolomide its convenience administration [ 2 ]
temozolomide demonstrated efficacy equal dtic phase iii trial dose 200 mg/m2/day 5 days every 28 days [ 6 ]
recent results large randomised phase iii trial (eortc 18032) examined efficacy extended schedule temozolomide (week on-week off 150 mg/m2/day 7 days repeated every 14 days) compared standard dose single-agent dtic showed no difference overall survival (os) progression-free survival (pfs) overall response rate (orr) between two arms [ 7 ]
combination chemotherapy associated response rate 30?50% but <5% complete responses median survival 9 months [ 2 5 ]
better-known combinations cisplatin?vinblastine?dacarbazine (cvd) cisplatin?dacarbazine?bcnu?tamoxifen (dartmouth regimen) [ 8 9 ]
although preliminary reports favoured use regimens over single-agent chemotherapy further comparisons dtic alone did not show differences survival even response rate [ 10 ]
addition combination chemotherapy produces significant toxicity
poor results single-agent combination chemotherapy regimens remained unchanged decades underscore need application fundamentally different strategies treatment advanced melanoma
substantial advances been made understanding genetic changes associated onset malignancy
reviewed elsewhere [ 11 ] consensus emerging about primary events involved development melanoma largely comparative genome hybridisation (cgh) [ 12 ]
include (a) up-regulation ras/raf/mek pathway [ 12 13 ] (b) down-regulation retinoblastoma protein (rb) increased cyclin d1 cdk4 activity [ 12 14 ] (c) inactivation cdkn2a p16 suppressor cdk4 6 >50% melanoma [ 12 15 ]
activating mutations c-kit fgf may occur some melanoma [ 16 ]
inactivation cdkn2a gene may affect production p14 arf (alternate reading frame) important maintenance p53 protein levels inhibiting hdm2-mediated ubiquitination p53 leads its degradation
numerous studies shown several signal pathways related survival cancer cells frequently up-regulated melanoma
arguably most important raf/ras/mek pathway involved proliferation resistance apoptosis
pathway turned activating mutations nras braf endogenous receptor?ligand interactions
importantly activation pathway shown related progression disease [ 17 ] resistance apoptosis [ 18 19 ]
another survival pathway pi3k/akt3 pathway activated 5?10% melanomas mutation phosphatase tensin (pten) protein receptor?ligand interactions activating mutations nras [ 20 ? 22 ]
src/stat3 pathway reported variably activated some melanoma lines metastatic melanoma vivo [ 23 ]

summarised tables 1 2 
many agents still being evaluated preclinical studies very few been evaluated randomised phase iii studies
sorafenib multikinase inhibitor selectivity b-raf c-raf vegfr-2 -3 platelet-derived growth factor receptor (pdgfr) c-kit
when used single agent stabilised disease 19% stage iv patients when given carboplatin paclitaxel induced promising objective responses pfs [ 27 ]
randomised phase ii trial comparing dtic without sorafenib twice-daily 400 mg doses conducted 101 patients
group receiving sorafenib pfs 21.1 weeks compared 11.7 weeks dtic-alone group
response rates 24% 12% respectively [ 28 ]
another phase ii trial complex design investigated sorafenib combination temozolomide
again encouraging response rates reported [ 29 ]
skin rashes haematologic toxicity main side-effects reported
phase iii trial recruited 270 patients second-line study compared carboplatin plus paclitaxel without sorafenib
median pfs 17.9 17.4 weeks placebo sorafenib groups respectively
orr 11% both groups [ 30 ]
although addition sorafenib did not improve pfs orr second-line patient population utility carboplatin plus paclitaxel sorafenib chemotherapy-naïve advanced melanoma patients remains determined
eastern cooperative oncology group (ecog) conducting similar trial previously untreated patients now closed accrual (ecog 2603)
results trial further studies sorafenib plus dtic awaited interest
ras/raf/mek signal pathway inhibitors akt receptor tyrosine kinase (rtk) stat signal pathway inhibitors specific mek inhibitor azd6244 evaluated randomised phase ii trial 200 patients stage iv melanoma
patients randomised azd6244 temozolomide recently reported results indicate there no significant difference pfs between those arms [ 34 ]
however azd6244 monotherapy resulted lasting remissions mainly patients documented b-raf mutations
combinations other agents such taxanes being planned
taxanes known activate anti-apoptotic mek pathway [ 48 ] combination therapy inhibitors pathway may beneficial
other two b-raf inhibitors raf265 plx4032 ( table 1 ) high affinity mutated b-raf dose-finding early phase ii studies
mek-specific inhibitor pd0325901 associated some retinal disturbances its further evaluation halted
tanespimycin (kos-953) inhibitor heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) targets proteins protected (chaperoned) hsp90
includes raf akt other signal pathway proteins
drug tested phase ii study previously treated stage iv melanoma patients administered twice weekly 2 weeks out 3 weeks
results treatment 14 patients met criteria further evaluation second stage trial [ 31 ]
another group farnesyl transferase inhibitors should theory inhibit activation ras
however when used single agent group drugs been disappointing [ 35 36 ]
most agents table 2 early stages investigation listed indicate rich supply agents remain evaluated treatment melanoma
given activation akt pathway been implicated resistance chemotherapy [ 22 ] trials inhibitors pathway downstream targets such mtor gsk3? hdm2 awaited much interest
key downstream target akt?mtor exists two complexes mtorc1 mtorc2
latter not inhibited rapamycin its analogues believed responsible rapamycin-induced activation akt pkc-? [ 49 ]
newer inhibitors target mtorc2 complex those inhibit both pi3k mtor (xl765) should avoid problem
xl765 proved well-tolerated phase i studies [ 42 ]
rich supply inhibitors receptor tyrosine kinases (rtks) such those against bcr-ab1 c-kit pdgfr epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr) c-met src may role treatment some melanomas
example high percentage mucosal acral melanoma some cutaneous melanoma amplified mutated c-kit may respond imatinib sunitinib dasatinib [ 44 45 ]
four phase ii trials sunitinib imatinib patients c-kit melanoma mutations ongoing
subgroup melanoma overexpression phosphorylated c-kit cdk4 resistant b-raf inhibitors but sensitive imatinib [ 50 ]
several agents indeterminate action such histamine [ 51 ] lenalidomide (cc-5013) [ 52 ] no longer under investigation
elesclomol (sta-4783) new agent appears increase reactive oxygen species
results recent randomised phase ii study elesclomol combination paclitaxel indicated significant benefit chemotherapy-naïve patients pfs (hr?=?0.315 p ?=?0.02) [ 53 ]
evaluation combination therapy progressed phase iii trial [ 54 ]
axitinib (ag-013736) oral inhibitor vegfr-1 -2 -3 c-kit pdgr-? pdgr-? early stage evaluation melanoma [ 55 ] recent results phase ii study demonstrated its single-agent activity subgroup melanoma patients [ 56 ]
another group new drugs targets anti-apoptotic proteins
mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathways regulated mainly bcl-2 family proteins reviewed elsewhere [ 57 ? 60 ] consists family bh3-only pro-apoptotic proteins two multi-domain pro-apoptotic proteins (bax bak) several multi-domain anti-apoptotic proteins (bcl-2 bcl-xl bcl-w mcl-1 a1)
one model binding anti-apoptotic proteins bh3 proteins displaces bax bak anti-apoptotic proteins allowing them bind mitochondria induce mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilisation (momp) [ 58 61 ]
certain bh3 proteins selectivity different anti-apoptotic proteins
particular noxa binds selectively mcl-1
latter binds bak hence noxa may displace bak mcl-1 allowing bind mitochondria [ 62 63 ]
particular interest immunohistological studies tissue sections melanoma shown mcl-1 bcl-xl increase expression progression disease whereas bcl-2 decreased during progression disease [ 64 ]
further studies needed define regulators proteins more closely particularly mcl-1 current studies suggest up-regulated part unfolded protein response endoplasmic reticulum stress [ 65 ]
findings important design treatment strategies melanoma
shown table 3 number new agents used clinically target anti-apoptotic proteins
oblimersen antisense agent targeted mitochondrial bcl-2
results randomised phase iii trial comparing dtic combined oblimersen dtic alone 771 patients showed improved pfs (2.6 months compared 1.6 months p ?<?0.01) response rate (13.5% compared 7.5% p ?=?0.007) but no statistical difference overall survival (9.0 months compared 7.8 months p ?=?0.077) [ 66 ]
problems study design failure measure tumour bcl-2 expression made results difficult interpret
significant interaction between baseline serum lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) treatment noted oblimersen significantly increasing survival patients normal ldh (11.4 months compared 9.7 months p ?=?0.02)
another agent abt-737 high affinity bcl-2 bcl-xl bcl-w but not mcl-1
preclinical studies shown many tumours resistant agent due its failure inhibit mcl-1 cancer cells down-regulation mcl-1 resulted sensitivity abt-737 [ 68 69 ]
abt-263 orally active form abt-737 [ 70 ]
sorafenib mek inhibitors may down-regulate mcl-1 may thus useful combination studies
shown table 3 however number protein inhibitors selectivity all anti-apoptotic proteins
one inhibitors obatoclax now preliminary trials patients haematological malignancies [ 75 ] shown overcome mcl-1 resistance apoptosis [ 76 ]
stage we would expect broad-spectrum inhibitors would more effective when given combination treatment induces apoptosis such immunotherapy chemotherapy
targeting anti-apoptotic proteins we may already agents would control disease targeted patient subgroups given appropriate combinations
number new agents various stages clinical evaluation
current strategy testing new targeted drugs single agents necessary but should regarded first step evaluation agent future combination other agents
example agents induce apoptosis such taxanes platinum compounds immunotherapy combined agents inhibit anti-apoptotic proteins
failure drug single agent probably no guide ultimate effectiveness drug when given combination planning trials combined agents would appear important part drug evaluation (e.g
carried out evaluation elesclomol?paclitaxel combination)
future research will need develop approaches help select subgroups patients more likely respond particular agents
combining high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays mutation analysis relevant oncogenes might provide rational basis sophisticated use new agents treatment melanoma [ 77 ]
improve outcome melanoma treatments determine biological mechanisms efficacy failure future studies small molecules targeted therapies will require strict monitoring biological end points
